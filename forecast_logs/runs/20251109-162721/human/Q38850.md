### Reference class & base rates
*   **States under existential threat pursuing nuclear weapons:** This class includes countries like Israel, Pakistan, and North Korea, which developed weapons in response to perceived overwhelming threats from neighbors. The success rate is high *once a program is committed to*, but the decision to start is rare. Over the past 50 years, perhaps 5-10 states have seriously considered or initiated a program under such duress. The base rate of a state in this situation *launching a program* in a given two-year period is low, perhaps **2-5%**. This is because the political, economic, and security costs are immense.
*   **States abandoning nuclear weapons/programs:** This class includes South Africa, Libya, and the post-Soviet states of Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine itself. The key reason for abandonment is typically a combination of extreme international pressure (sanctions) and/or the provision of alternative security arrangements and integration into the international community. The rate of "re-nuclearization" for this class is effectively zero to date.
*   **States with advanced civilian nuclear programs:** Many countries (e.g., Japan, Germany, South Korea, Iran) have the technical capacity to develop weapons but are constrained by international treaties (NPT), alliances, and the immense diplomatic and economic fallout. The rate of one of these states starting a *weapons* program in any two-year period is extremely low, **<1%**.

**Reasoning:** Ukraine sits at the intersection of these classes. It has the existential threat (Class 1), a history of abandonment (Class 2), and the latent technical capacity (Class 3). The constraints from Class 2 & 3 (international norms, treaties, and reliance on allies) are currently the dominant factors, suggesting a very low base rate.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-10-15** US Congress passes a short-term funding bill for Ukraine, but aid levels are reduced and future commitments are tied to contentious political debates, signaling wavering long-term support. (↑) — Matters because it weakens the primary alternative to a domestic deterrent: robust, reliable Western backing.
*   **2025-09-20** During the UN General Assembly, President Zelenskyy reiterates that Ukraine's security lies within the Euro-Atlantic framework, but pointedly notes that "security assurances must be bankable, not just memorable." (↑) — Matters as it keeps the failure of the Budapest Memorandum in the spotlight, framing the need for stronger guarantees, with the nuclear option as an implicit, unstated alternative.
*   **2025-08-05** The IAEA, in its quarterly report on Ukraine, confirms full cooperation and accountability for all declared nuclear material at sites under Ukrainian control, noting enhanced surveillance measures. (↓) — Matters because it confirms Ukraine is adhering to its NPT obligations, making a clandestine diversion of material for a weapons program more difficult and politically costly.
*   **2025-06-15** A bilateral security agreement between Ukraine and the United Kingdom comes into full effect, codifying long-term military and intelligence support, though it falls short of a mutual defense pact like NATO's Article 5. (↓) — Matters because it provides a layer of security, reducing the perceived need for an ultimate deterrent, even if it's not the "ironclad" guarantee Kyiv ultimately seeks.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **Collapse of Western Support (Large ↑):** If financial and military aid from the US and Europe were to cease, Ukraine might conclude it has been abandoned and that a nuclear deterrent is the only path to long-term survival. This is the most significant potential driver.
*   **Definitive Rejection of NATO Membership (Moderate ↑):** A formal, final declaration from NATO that Ukraine will not be offered membership could trigger a strategic reassessment in Kyiv, making the nuclear option more palatable as the primary alternative.
*   **Credible Russian Nuclear Escalation (Small ↑):** While Russian nuclear threats have been common, a move that the West and Ukraine perceive as a genuine prelude to use (e.g., tactical nuke deployment to Belarus, doctrinal changes) could increase the perceived utility of a deterrent, though it would not overcome the immediate constraints.
*   **Dependence on Western Aid (Large ↓):** Ukraine's war effort and economy are entirely dependent on Western support. Starting a nuclear program would violate the NPT, instantly alienate its backers, and lead to the cessation of aid, which would be a suicidal act in the short term.
*   **International Treaties & IAEA Oversight (Moderate ↓):** As a signatory to the NPT, Ukraine is subject to IAEA inspections. Diverting nuclear material from its civilian program would be detected quickly, triggering international condemnation and sanctions.
*   **Technical & Logistical Hurdles (Moderate ↓):** While Ukraine has a strong scientific base, re-establishing the full fuel cycle for weapons-grade material and the weaponization infrastructure would take years and significant resources, all while fighting a full-scale war. It is not a quick or easy process.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Unprecedented Dependence on Sponsoring Allies:** Unlike past proliferators (e.g., Pakistan, North Korea) who often had a major power's tacit support or operated in a more multi-polar dynamic, Ukraine's survival is singularly dependent on a coalition of Western states that are staunchly anti-proliferation.
*   **Active High-Intensity War:** Attempting to launch a secret, resource-intensive nuclear program while fighting for national survival is a unique and profoundly difficult challenge. Facilities would be vulnerable to Russian strikes.
*   **Prior Status as a Nuclear Power:** Ukraine is unique in having possessed and voluntarily relinquished the world's third-largest nuclear arsenal. This history provides both the latent expertise (a "brain trust") and the deep-seated political trauma (the Budapest Memorandum's failure) that informs the current debate.
*   **Intense International Scrutiny:** Ukraine's civilian nuclear facilities are under the most intense international microscope in the world due to the war and Russian occupation of the ZNPP. This makes clandestine diversion of materials exceptionally difficult.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a very low prior, anchored on the reference class of states re-proliferating or new states starting programs under intense Western scrutiny. A prior of **~1%** with an equivalent n of 100 seems appropriate, reflecting strong structural constraints.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑ Large) The existential motive created by Russian aggression and the failure of the Budapest Memorandum.
    *   (↑ Moderate) Wavering long-term commitment from key allies, particularly the US, which weakens the non-nuclear alternative.
    *   (↓ Large) The immediate, existential need for Western conventional military and financial aid, which a nuclear program would jeopardize.
    *   (↓ Moderate) The technical difficulty and long timeline of developing a weapon during a devastating war.
    *   (↓ Moderate) Strong IAEA oversight and Ukraine's current adherence to NPT obligations.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence for "No" is immediate, tangible, and linked to short-term survival (aid). The evidence for "Yes" is based on a long-term strategic logic that is currently self-defeating. The posterior should remain very low, likely staying at or below the initial 1% prior.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Any official Ukrainian withdrawal from the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).
    *   Expulsion of or refusal of access to IAEA inspectors from any nuclear facility under Ukrainian control.
    *   Intelligence reports from Western agencies of suspicious procurement activities related to enrichment or reprocessing technology.
    *   High-level rhetoric from top officials (e.g., President, Foreign Minister) shifting from "we need security guarantees" to "we will guarantee our own security by any means necessary."
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   The signing of a formal, bilateral mutual defense treaty with the United States.
    *   A concrete and irrevocable Membership Action Plan (MAP) or direct invitation to join NATO.
    *   Approval of multi-year, large-scale aid packages from the US and EU, solidifying long-term support.
    *   Continued public statements from Ukrainian leadership committing to the NPT.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Resolution Criteria:** The question resolves on a "credible report," not on the actual existence of a program. A successful Russian disinformation campaign that is temporarily picked up by a major media outlet could trigger a "Yes" resolution.
*   **Definition of "Program":** The term "nuclear weapons program" is ambiguous. Does it mean theoretical research, computer modeling, or active efforts to acquire fissile material? A report could be misinterpreted.
*   **Secrecy:** Any real program would be one of the most closely guarded secrets in the world. It is unlikely to be detected until it is either well-advanced or deliberately revealed.
*   **Timeline:** The resolution date is less than two months from the current date (2025-11-09). This is an exceptionally short window for a state to launch a program *and* for it to be credibly reported. This short horizon is a powerful factor favoring "No."

**Final Research Summary:**
Despite a powerful long-term motive born from the failure of the Budapest Memorandum, Ukraine's absolute short-term dependence on Western aid makes launching a nuclear program a self-defeating act. The immense diplomatic, economic, and security costs, combined with the extremely short timeline to resolution, keep the probability exceptionally low.

To forecast the probability of Ukraine launching a nuclear weapons program before 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The base rate for a state launching a nuclear weapons program under existential threat is estimated at **2-5%** over a two-year period. This is based on historical cases where countries like Israel, Pakistan, and North Korea pursued nuclear weapons due to perceived threats. However, the decision to start such a program is rare due to immense political, economic, and security costs.

**Chosen Prior:** Given Ukraine's unique situation, a prior probability of **1%** is appropriate. This reflects the strong constraints from international norms, treaties, and reliance on allies, which are currently dominant.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
**Similarities:**
- Ukraine faces an existential threat from Russia, similar to other states that pursued nuclear weapons.
- Ukraine has the technical capacity due to its advanced civilian nuclear program.

**Differences:**
- Ukraine's dependence on Western aid is unprecedented, making a nuclear program self-defeating.
- Ukraine is under intense international scrutiny, making clandestine development difficult.
- Ukraine has a history of nuclear disarmament, unlike other proliferators.

These differences suggest a lower probability than the base rate.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Existential Threat (↑):** The ongoing war with Russia and failure of the Budapest Memorandum increase the motive for a nuclear deterrent. However, this is countered by the immediate need for Western aid.
- **Wavering Western Support (↑):** Reduced aid signals potential weakening of non-nuclear alternatives, slightly increasing the probability.
- **IAEA Oversight (↓):** Full cooperation with the IAEA and adherence to NPT obligations decrease the likelihood of a clandestine program.
- **Dependence on Aid (↓):** The need for Western support is critical, making a nuclear program highly unlikely.
- **Technical Hurdles (↓):** Developing a nuclear weapon is resource-intensive and time-consuming, especially during a war.

**Net Effect:** The evidence for "No" is stronger due to immediate survival needs and international constraints.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
**Prior Odds:** 1% probability translates to odds of 1:99.

**Likelihood Ratio:** The combined evidence suggests a likelihood ratio significantly less than 1, reinforcing the "No" outcome.

**Posterior Odds:** Prior odds × Likelihood ratio = 1:99 × (much less than 1) = even lower odds.

**Posterior Probability:** The posterior probability remains very low, likely below the initial 1%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the possibility of a rapid geopolitical shift or clandestine developments.
- **Alternative Scenarios:** A sudden collapse of Western support or a dramatic escalation by Russia could alter the calculus.
- **Rebuttals:** Ukraine's leadership has consistently sought Western integration, making a nuclear program less plausible.

### 6. Final Forecast
Considering the base rate, evidence, and potential alternative scenarios, the probability of Ukraine launching a nuclear weapons program before 2026 remains exceptionally low.

Final: 1%

# Will Ukraine launch a nuclear weapons program before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to identify an appropriate base rate for a country launching a nuclear weapons program under Ukraine's specific circumstances.

The most relevant reference classes include:
- Countries that previously gave up nuclear weapons (Belarus, Kazakhstan, South Africa, Ukraine)
- Countries under existential threat considering nuclear deterrence
- Countries with advanced civilian nuclear infrastructure but under NPT constraints

Looking at these reference classes:
- No country that has voluntarily given up nuclear weapons has ever restarted a program
- Countries under existential threat have occasionally pursued nuclear weapons (Israel, Pakistan, North Korea)
- Countries with advanced nuclear infrastructure rarely convert to weapons programs due to international constraints

Given these considerations, I'll use a very low prior of **1%**. This reflects:
- The unprecedented nature of a country reacquiring nuclear weapons after giving them up
- The extreme international costs of violating the NPT
- The technical and resource challenges of starting a program during wartime

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Ukraine has the technical foundation (civilian nuclear infrastructure, uranium deposits)
- Ukraine faces a genuine existential threat from Russia
- Ukraine has explicitly mentioned nuclear weapons as a potential option if NATO membership is denied

**Key differences:**
- Ukraine is currently in an active high-intensity war, making resource allocation to a nuclear program extremely difficult
- Ukraine is completely dependent on Western military and financial aid for survival
- The timeline is extremely short (less than two months until resolution)
- Ukraine is under intense international scrutiny, including IAEA monitoring

These differences significantly reduce the likelihood compared to historical cases of proliferation, which typically occurred over many years and with at least tacit support from a major power.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence increasing probability:**
1. **Ukrainian officials' statements about reconsidering nuclear status**
   - P(E|H): ~90% (If Ukraine were planning a program, such statements would be expected)
   - P(E|~H): ~30% (These statements could be strategic leverage even without actual intent)
   - Likelihood ratio: ~3.0 (Moderate increase)

2. **Failure of Budapest Memorandum security guarantees**
   - P(E|H): ~95% (A nuclear program would be a direct response to this failure)
   - P(E|~H): ~100% (This failure is evident regardless of nuclear intentions)
   - Likelihood ratio: ~0.95 (Slight decrease)

3. **Wavering Western support and aid uncertainty**
   - P(E|H): ~80% (Reduced confidence in allies would increase nuclear incentives)
   - P(E|~H): ~70% (Aid uncertainty exists regardless of nuclear intentions)
   - Likelihood ratio: ~1.14 (Very slight increase)

**Evidence decreasing probability:**
1. **Dependence on Western aid for immediate survival**
   - P(E|H): ~10% (Starting a program would jeopardize vital aid)
   - P(E|~H): ~95% (Without a program, aid continues)
   - Likelihood ratio: ~0.11 (Strong decrease)

2. **IAEA oversight and NPT compliance**
   - P(E|H): ~20% (A program would require evading or ending this oversight)
   - P(E|~H): ~90% (Continued compliance is expected without a program)
   - Likelihood ratio: ~0.22 (Strong decrease)

3. **Technical challenges during wartime**
   - P(E|H): ~30% (A program would face severe resource constraints)
   - P(E|~H): ~95% (These challenges are irrelevant without a program)
   - Likelihood ratio: ~0.32 (Significant decrease)

4. **Extremely short timeline to resolution (< 2 months)**
   - P(E|H): ~5% (Very little time for program launch and credible reporting)
   - P(E|~H): ~99% (Time constraint irrelevant without a program)
   - Likelihood ratio: ~0.05 (Very strong decrease)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior of 1% (odds of 1:99), I'll update based on the strongest evidence:

**Update on Western aid dependence:**
- Prior odds: 1:99 (0.01 probability)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.11
- Posterior odds: 0.11:99 ≈ 1:900
- Posterior probability: 1/901 ≈ 0.11%

**Update on extremely short timeline:**
- Prior odds: 0.11:99.89
- Likelihood ratio: 0.05
- Posterior odds: 0.0055:99.89 ≈ 1:18,162
- Posterior probability: 1/18,163 ≈ 0.0055%

This extremely low probability reflects the combined impact of Ukraine's dependence on Western aid and the very short timeline remaining before resolution.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating Ukraine's desperation if they believe Western support is collapsing
- There could be secret preparations already underway that haven't been detected
- A "program" might be defined more broadly than I'm considering (e.g., preliminary research)
- Russian disinformation could create a "credible report" that triggers resolution

**Alternative scenarios:**
- Ukraine might have maintained some nuclear expertise and materials from Soviet times that could accelerate a program
- A third country might secretly assist Ukraine's nuclear ambitions
- Ukraine might calculate that the benefits of nuclear deterrence outweigh the short-term costs of lost aid

After considering these factors, I should adjust my probability slightly upward from the mechanistic calculation, but it remains extremely low given the constraints.

## 6. Final Forecast

Considering all factors, especially:
1. The unprecedented nature of a country reacquiring nuclear weapons after giving them up
2. Ukraine's existential dependence on Western aid that would be jeopardized
3. The extremely short timeline remaining before resolution (less than 2 months)
4. The technical challenges of starting a program during an active war
5. The intense international scrutiny and IAEA monitoring

I assess the probability as extremely low, but not absolutely zero due to the possibility of unexpected developments or definitional edge cases.

Final: 0.5%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

To establish a prior probability, I will consider the reference class of states that have previously abandoned nuclear weapons or programs. This class includes South Africa, Libya, and the post-Soviet states of Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine itself. To date, the rate of any of these states "re-proliferating" by launching a new nuclear weapons program is zero.

A second, broader reference class is states with advanced civilian nuclear capabilities under the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) that face significant security threats (e.g., Japan, South Korea, Taiwan historically). The rate at which these states have formally launched a weapons program is also exceptionally low, effectively near zero over any short time period.

Given these reference classes, a strong prior exists against a state like Ukraine, which is a signatory to the NPT and has a history of denuclearization, starting a new program. I will set a conservative base rate (prior) of **1%** for Ukraine launching such a program within a two-year timeframe, reflecting that while structurally unlikely, its unique existential threat makes it a non-zero possibility.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities:** Like other states that have considered proliferation (e.g., Israel, Pakistan), Ukraine faces a clear and present existential threat from a nuclear-armed adversary. The failure of the 1994 Budapest Memorandum provides a powerful rationale for self-reliance, a key driver in historical proliferation cases. Ukraine also possesses significant latent technical capacity from its Soviet-era weapons programs and its large civilian nuclear industry.

*   **Differences:** The most critical difference is Ukraine's profound and immediate dependence on a coalition of Western nations for its survival. These nations, particularly the United States, are the primary architects and enforcers of the global non-proliferation regime. Unlike past proliferators who often had tacit support or operated with more strategic autonomy, any move by Ukraine towards a nuclear program would almost certainly trigger an immediate halt to the military and financial aid it needs to continue fighting Russia. This makes the act of starting a program suicidal in the short term. Furthermore, Ukraine is fighting an active, high-intensity conventional war, making the allocation of immense resources to a secret, long-term nuclear program exceptionally difficult.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

Let H be the hypothesis that "Ukraine launches a nuclear weapons program before 2026."

*   **Evidence 1: Extreme dependence on Western aid.**
    *   P(E | H): Very low. It is highly unlikely Ukraine would launch a program, as this action would directly threaten the aid flows essential for its immediate survival.
    *   P(E | ~H): Very high. Ukraine's continued non-nuclear status is a precondition for the massive support it receives.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio << 1.** This evidence strongly decreases the probability.

*   **Evidence 2: The extremely short timeline.** The resolution date is January 1, 2026, which is less than two months from the current date in the scenario (November 9, 2025).
    *   P(E | H): Very low. A decision of this magnitude is a major strategic shift. For it to be made, implemented to a detectable stage, and then credibly reported by a major international source all within seven weeks is extraordinarily improbable.
    *   P(E | ~H): Very high. The status quo requires no action and is the default outcome.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio << 1.** This is another piece of very strong evidence against the event occurring within the specified timeframe.

*   **Evidence 3: Wavering long-term support from allies (e.g., contentious US aid debates).**
    *   P(E | H): High. A perception of abandonment is the primary catalyst that would make Ukraine consider the nuclear option.
    *   P(E | ~H): Moderate. Wavering support can occur for many domestic political reasons, even if Ukraine remains non-nuclear.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio > 1.** This evidence increases the probability by strengthening the long-term motive.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)

Starting with a prior of 1% (odds of 1:99), we must update based on the evidence. The two most powerful pieces of evidence are the dependence on aid and the short timeline.

*   **Initial Prior:** P(H) = 1% (Odds = 1:99)
*   **Update with "Dependence on Aid":** This factor makes launching a program self-defeating in the immediate term. The likelihood ratio is very small (e.g., 1/20). Posterior odds ≈ (1:99) * (1/20) = 1:1980. This alone drops the probability to ~0.05%.
*   **Update with "Short Timeline":** This factor further reduces the probability. A 1% base rate for a two-year period, naively scaled to a two-month period, would be less than 0.1%.
*   **Update with "Wavering Support":** This pushes the probability back up, but not enough to counteract the overwhelming structural and temporal constraints.

The combined effect of the evidence, especially the immediate suicidal consequences and the impossibly short timeline, drives the probability far below the initial 1% prior. The posterior probability for an *actual* program being launched and reported is extremely low, likely less than 0.5%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My analysis might be flawed if I underestimate certain scenarios. The primary blind spot is the resolution criteria, which hinges on a "credible report" rather than the actual existence of a program.

*   **Alternative Scenario 1: Political Gambit.** Ukraine could *announce* the start of a program as a desperate bluff to force the West to provide ironclad security guarantees or NATO membership. This would trigger a "Yes" resolution even if no physical program existed.
*   **Alternative Scenario 2: Disinformation.** Russia has a strong incentive to fabricate and plant evidence of a Ukrainian nuclear program to disrupt the Western alliance and halt aid to Kyiv. If a major media outlet were to pick up such a story and not retract it within a month, the question would resolve "Yes."

These scenarios are more plausible paths to a "Yes" resolution than the actual launch of a program. The probability of such a high-stakes bluff or a successful major disinformation campaign in the next seven weeks is low, but it is not zero. I must assign some probability to these "resolution-hacking" scenarios. I will estimate the probability of these events at approximately 0.5%.

Combining the near-zero chance of an actual program launch with the small but non-trivial chance of a resolution via bluff or disinformation, the final probability should be slightly higher than my initial posterior.

### 6. Final Forecast

The fundamental constraints on Ukraine—its total dependence on Western aid and the extremely short timeline for resolution—make the launch of an actual nuclear weapons program before 2026 exceptionally unlikely. The primary risk of a "Yes" resolution comes from non-technical events, such as a political bluff by Kyiv or a successful Russian disinformation campaign that meets the credibility criteria. While the motive for Ukraine to consider a nuclear deterrent is growing, the immediate costs are too high. The final probability remains very low, dominated by the powerful constraints but slightly elevated to account for the specific wording of the resolution criteria.

Final: 1%
