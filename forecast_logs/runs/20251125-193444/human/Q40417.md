### Reference class & base rates
-   **Reference Class 1: Post-LadBaby Era (2023-2024).** This is the most recent and structurally similar period, characterized by the absence of a dominant, recurring charity/novelty act.
    -   **Base Rates:** 1980s: 100% (2/2); All other decades: 0%.
    -   **Reasoning:** This class reflects the current market dynamics where, without a strong contemporary challenger, a streaming-supported classic can win.
    -   **Limitations:** Extremely small sample size (n=2), making it highly sensitive to new information but potentially the best indicator of the new "default" state.

-   **Reference Class 2: Post-Streaming Dominance Era (c. 2015-2024).** This period captures the modern music consumption landscape where streaming plays a decisive role, but it also includes the LadBaby anomaly.
    -   **Base Rates (approximate):** 2020s: 30% (3/10); 2010s: 40% (4/10); 1980s: 20% (2/10); 1970s: 10% (1/10, Band Aid cover).
    -   **Reasoning:** This class shows the potential for both newly released songs (often novelty/charity) and legacy classics to win in the streaming era.
    -   **Limitations:** The five-year LadBaby streak represents a specific, organized campaign that may not be replicable, potentially overstating the probability of a new novelty song.

-   **Reference Class 3: Full History (1952-2024).** The entire history of the UK Christmas number one.
    -   **Base Rates (approximate):** Contemporary Decade (song released in the same decade as it charted): ~85-90%. Non-Contemporary: ~10-15%.
    -   **Reasoning:** Provides the longest-run historical average.
    -   **Limitations:** Structurally irrelevant. The market has fundamentally changed from physical sales to streaming, making this class a poor guide for the present. The mechanisms that drove outcomes in the 20th century are no longer dominant.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
-   **2024-12-20** Wham!'s "Last Christmas" (1984) confirmed as Christmas number one. — ↓ (for 2020s) — Reinforces the 2023 result, establishing a powerful precedent and a new "status quo" where a legacy song wins in the absence of a major challenger.
-   **2024-11-20** Bookmakers open their 2025 Christmas #1 market. — ↑ (for 1980s/classics) — Early odds from bookmakers list several classics like "Last Christmas" and "Fairytale of New York" as favorites, reflecting an expectation of the recent trend continuing.
-   **2024-10-15** Major UK influencer groups (e.g., Sidemen) release autumn content with no mention of a Christmas single. — ↓ (for 2020s) — The lack of early signals from reliable creators of viral, contemporary campaigns suggests a key path to a 2020s winner is not being pursued.
-   **2023-12-22** Wham!'s "Last Christmas" (1984) becomes Christmas number one for the first time. — ↓ (for 2020s) — Marked the end of the LadBaby era and the beginning of a potential new regime where streaming inertia for classics triumphs over disorganized contemporary competition.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
-   **Streaming Inertia (Large):** Classic Christmas songs are added to millions of personal and curated playlists (e.g., on Spotify, Amazon Music) and receive massive passive airplay. This gives them an enormous baseline of "votes" each week in December. This strongly favors well-known songs from the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s.
-   **Organized Social Media Campaign (Large):** A coordinated effort to push a specific song, new or old, can disrupt the status quo. This was the mechanism for Rage Against the Machine (1992) in 2009 and is the most likely path to victory for a non-obvious candidate. The target could be from any decade.
-   **Charity/Novelty Single (Large):** The LadBaby phenomenon (2018-2022) demonstrated the power of a compelling, family-friendly charity narrative. Such a release would almost certainly be a new recording, placing it in the 2020s. Its success depends entirely on the emergence of a charismatic and effective campaigner.
-   **Major Artist Release (Moderate-Large):** A surprise Christmas-themed single from a global superstar (e.g., Taylor Swift, Ed Sheeran, Adele) could consolidate the market. This would be a 2020s release. However, top artists often avoid the crowded and unpredictable Christmas chart race.
-   **Media Narrative (Moderate):** The story around the race matters. In 2023, the narrative was "Let's finally get Wham! to the top." A new narrative could emerge, such as "Let's get a new song for Christmas" or focusing on another classic like The Pogues' "Fairytale of New York" (1987).

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
-   **Power Vacuum:** Unlike the X Factor (2005-2013) or LadBaby (2018-2022) eras, there is no single, dominant, recurring force manufacturing a contemporary hit for the Christmas market. This vacuum allows other mechanisms, like streaming, to dominate.
-   **Streaming vs. Sales:** The chart is now a hybrid of streaming and sales, where streaming volume is paramount. This structurally favors older, universally known songs over new tracks that need to build an audience from scratch in a short period.
-   **Decline of the "Winner's Single":** The end of *The X Factor* removed the primary source of guaranteed, high-publicity contemporary releases timed specifically for the Christmas chart battle.
-   **Campaign Fatigue:** After the anti-X Factor and pro-LadBaby campaigns, there may be general public fatigue with organized efforts, leading to a more "natural" outcome determined by passive listening habits (which favors classics).

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
-   **Prior:** Start with the Post-LadBaby Era (n=2) as the most relevant reference class. This places a very high prior on the 1980s (~100%). This is a strong but brittle prior due to the small n.
-   **Evidence mapping:**
    -   (↑ 1980s, Large) The 2024 repeat win for Wham! strongly confirms the 2023 result as a new regime, not a one-off.
    -   (↑ 1980s/Classics, Moderate) The structural dominance of streaming provides a constant tailwind for legacy songs with high playlist inclusion.
    -   (↓ 2020s, Moderate) The current lack of any announced, credible charity or novelty campaign to fill the LadBaby void makes a contemporary winner less likely.
    -   (↑ 2020s, Small) The possibility of a surprise social media campaign or major artist release remains, representing a small but non-zero chance of a 2020s winner.
-   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly reinforces the prior derived from the 2023-2024 period. The posterior should be heavily concentrated on the 1980s, with some spillover probability to other "classic" decades (1970s, 1990s). The 2020s option should be seen as a low-probability outlier.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
-   **UP indicators (for a 2020s winner):**
    -   Announcement of a major charity single backed by a credible organization (e.g., Trussell Trust, NHS) and a popular public figure.
    -   A new song gaining significant traction on TikTok with a Christmas theme in early December.
    -   Bookmakers' odds for a specific 2020s song shortening dramatically (e.g., from 50/1 to 5/1).
    -   A surprise single release announced by a UK-centric megastar like Ed Sheeran or Adele for mid-December.

-   **DOWN indicators (for a 2020s winner):**
    -   Mid-week chart updates in December showing 2-3 classic Christmas songs locked in the top spots.
    -   Media coverage framing the race as a battle between two classics (e.g., Wham! vs. Mariah Carey vs. The Pogues).
    -   The absence of any breakout 2020s song in the top 20 by the second week of December.
    -   LadBaby explicitly confirming they will not be releasing a 2025 single.

### Caveats & pitfalls
-   **Small N Precedent:** The "new regime" of classic songs winning is based on only two data points (2023, 2024). This pattern could be easily broken.
-   **Black Swan Campaign:** A highly effective, out-of-nowhere social media campaign could emerge in the final two weeks, making early indicators misleading. The chart race is known for its volatility.
-   **Definitional Ambiguity:** A "2020s" winner could be a cover of a much older song (e.g., LadBaby's songs were covers). The resolution criteria refer to

To forecast the decade in which the 2025 UK Christmas number one will have been originally released, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

- **1960s or earlier:** Historically, songs from this era have not been prominent in recent Christmas number ones. Base rate: 0%.
- **1970s:** Occasionally, songs from this decade have been popular, but not dominant. Base rate: 10%.
- **1980s:** Recent trends show a strong preference for this decade, with Wham!'s "Last Christmas" winning in 2023 and 2024. Base rate: 100% for the Post-LadBaby Era, but adjusted to 50% considering broader historical context.
- **1990s:** While possible, songs from this decade have not been recent winners. Base rate: 10%.
- **2000s:** Songs from this decade have not been significant in recent years. Base rate: 5%.
- **2010s:** Some presence in recent years, but less likely given current trends. Base rate: 10%.
- **2020s:** While new releases are possible, the lack of a strong contemporary challenger reduces this likelihood. Base rate: 15%.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

- **Similarity:** The current scenario is similar to the Post-LadBaby Era, where classics dominate due to streaming inertia.
- **Difference:** The absence of a dominant contemporary act or campaign makes the situation unique, potentially favoring older songs.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

- **1980s:** The repeat win of "Last Christmas" in 2023 and 2024 strongly supports the dominance of 1980s classics. Likelihood: High.
- **2020s:** The lack of a major contemporary release or campaign reduces the likelihood of a 2020s song. Likelihood: Low.
- **Other Decades:** The structural dominance of streaming and the absence of strong campaigns make other decades less likely. Likelihood: Moderate to Low.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

- **1980s:** Prior odds are high due to recent wins. The likelihood of continued dominance through streaming supports a strong posterior probability.
- **2020s:** Despite some potential for surprise releases, the lack of evidence for a strong contender reduces the posterior probability.
- **Other Decades:** The evidence does not strongly support a shift away from the 1980s dominance, keeping posterior probabilities low.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

- **Overconfidence Check:** The reliance on a small sample size (2023-2024) could lead to overconfidence in the 1980s. Consider the potential for a surprise campaign.
- **Alternative Scenarios:** A successful social media campaign or a surprise release from a major artist could shift probabilities towards the 2020s.
- **Adjustments:** Slightly increase the probability for the 2020s to account for unforeseen campaigns or releases.

### 6. Final Normalization

Ensure probabilities sum to approximately 100% and reflect the evidence and reasoning.

### 7. Output Format

1960s or earlier: 0%  
1970s: 5%  
1980s: 60%  
1990s: 10%  
2000s: 5%  
2010s: 10%  
2020s: 10%  

These probabilities reflect the current evidence and trends, with a strong emphasis on the dominance of 1980s classics in the absence of a strong contemporary challenger.

# Forecasting the Decade of the 2025 UK Christmas Number One

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll consider multiple reference classes to establish priors:

**Reference Class A: Most Recent Years (2023-2024)**
- 2023: "Last Christmas" by Wham! (1984) - 1980s
- 2024: "Last Christmas" by Wham! (1984) - 1980s
- Base rate: 1980s (100%), all other decades (0%)

**Reference Class B: Post-Streaming Era (2015-2024)**
- Approximate distribution: 2020s (30%), 2010s (40%), 1980s (20%), other decades (10%)

**Reference Class C: Full History (1952-2024)**
- Contemporary releases typically dominate (~85-90%)
- Non-contemporary releases are rare (~10-15%)

I'll primarily use Reference Class A as my starting point since it represents the most recent pattern and current market dynamics, but I'll adjust based on the limitations of its small sample size.

Initial priors:
- 1960s or earlier: 1%
- 1970s: 2%
- 1980s: 70%
- 1990s: 5%
- 2000s: 2%
- 2010s: 5%
- 2020s: 15%

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- The streaming-dominated market structure remains in place
- The absence of LadBaby or X Factor as dominant forces continues
- Classic Christmas songs have established streaming inertia
- "Last Christmas" has now established a precedent as a Christmas #1

**Differences from base case:**
- The novelty of "Last Christmas" finally reaching #1 has worn off
- There's more time for new campaigns to organize for 2025
- The music industry may adapt strategies based on the 2023-2024 results
- Other classic Christmas songs may gain momentum to challenge "Last Christmas"

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence 1: Streaming Inertia for Classics**
- P(E|1980s): Very High - The 1980s contains several Christmas classics with massive streaming numbers
- P(E|1970s): High - Songs like "Merry Xmas Everybody" (Slade) have strong streaming presence
- P(E|1990s): Moderate - Fewer Christmas classics from this era
- P(E|2020s): Low - New songs must build streaming momentum from scratch

**Evidence 2: Absence of Dominant Contemporary Force**
- P(E|1980s): High - Creates space for classics to dominate
- P(E|2020s): Low - Makes it harder for new releases without established platforms

**Evidence 3: Two Consecutive Wins for "Last Christmas"**
- P(E|1980s): Very High - Establishes a pattern specifically for 1980s music
- P(E|Other decades): Low - Suggests other decades are currently less competitive

**Evidence 4: Potential for New Campaigns**
- P(E|2020s): Moderate - A well-organized charity campaign could emerge
- P(E|1980s): Moderate - The current pattern could be disrupted

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

Starting with my prior for the 1980s (70%):

**Update on Evidence 1 (Streaming Inertia):**
- Prior odds for 1980s: 70/30 = 2.33
- Likelihood ratio: ~3 (Very High/Moderate)
- Posterior odds: 2.33 × 3 = 7
- Posterior probability: 7/(1+7) ≈ 87.5%

This is too extreme based on just one factor. Let me consider all evidence together more holistically:

The streaming inertia and recent precedent strongly favor the 1980s, but I need to account for:
- The possibility of a new charity single (like LadBaby's previous successes)
- The chance of a major artist releasing a strategic Christmas single
- The potential for a social media campaign to elevate a different classic

Adjusting my posterior probabilities:
- 1980s: ~65% (strong but not overwhelming)
- 2020s: ~20% (significant chance of a new campaign)
- 1990s: ~7% (some classics from this era could gain momentum)
- 1970s: ~5% (contains some enduring Christmas classics)
- 2010s: ~2% (recent but not current songs)
- 2000s: ~1% (few Christmas classics from this era)
- 1960s or earlier: ~0% (extremely unlikely)

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overweighting the 2023-2024 pattern with only two data points
- I might be underestimating the music industry's ability to manufacture a hit
- I could be overlooking the potential for a viral TikTok Christmas song from 2025

**Alternative scenarios:**
- A major artist (Taylor Swift, Ed Sheeran, Adele) could release a Christmas single specifically timed for the chart
- A charity campaign similar to LadBaby could emerge with strong public support
- A different classic from the 1970s or 1990s could gain momentum through a targeted campaign

**Adjustments:**
- I should increase the probability for 2020s slightly to account for industry adaptation
- I should distribute more probability to other decades with Christmas classics

## 6. Final Normalization

Adjusting my probabilities to account for red team considerations:

- 1960s or earlier: 1% (minimal chance but not impossible)
- 1970s: 6% (contains several Christmas classics with streaming potential)
- 1980s: 60% (strong recent precedent but not guaranteed)
- 1990s: 8% (some Christmas classics with potential)
- 2000s: 2% (few Christmas classics but not impossible)
- 2010s: 3% (recent songs with some streaming presence)
- 2020s: 20% (significant chance of a new campaign or major artist release)

## 7. Final Forecast

1960s or earlier: 1%
1970s: 6%
1980s: 60%
1990s: 8%
2000s: 2%
2010s: 3%
2020s: 20%
(sum 100%)

```md

Here is my probabilistic forecast and reasoning.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

My primary reference class is the **Post-LadBaby Era (2023-2024)**. This is the most relevant period because it reflects the current structural reality of the UK Christmas chart race: the absence of a dominant, recurring contemporary hit-maker like LadBaby (2018-2022) or The X Factor (2005-2013).

*   **Base Rate from this class:**
    *   1980s: 100% (2 out of 2 wins)
    *   All other decades: 0%

This base rate is extremely strong but derived from a very small sample size (n=2), so it should be treated as a powerful starting point to be tempered by other factors, rather than a definitive probability. It suggests that the "default" outcome in the current environment is a well-loved classic from the 1980s.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities:** The 2025 race, as of now, looks structurally identical to 2023 and 2024. There is no announced, high-profile, recurring charity campaign. The charts are dominated by streaming, which favors songs with high passive listenership on playlists. This creates a "power vacuum" that established classics are perfectly positioned to fill.

*   **Differences & Why They Matter:** The key difference from longer-term history is the absence of a "hit machine." For over a decade, the race was defined by organized campaigns (anti-X Factor, pro-LadBaby) or manufactured hits (X Factor winners). Without this, the underlying force of streaming inertia becomes the dominant factor. The two-year precedent of "Last Christmas" winning may also create a counter-reaction or "voter fatigue," potentially opening the door for a different song, though not necessarily a contemporary one.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will evaluate key pieces of evidence and their impact on the probability of a win for different decades.

*   **Evidence 1: Wham!'s "Last Christmas" (1984) won in both 2023 and 2024.**
    *   This evidence makes an **80s** win much more likely. The likelihood of seeing two consecutive 80s wins is very high if the new "default" is an 80s classic (P(E|H_80s) is high). The likelihood of this happening by chance if the winner was truly random or biased towards new songs is very low (P(E|~H_80s) is low). This provides a strong update in favor of the 1980s.

*   **Evidence 2: The structural dominance of streaming.**
    *   Streaming favors songs already on millions of playlists. This strongly supports all "classic" Christmas decades, particularly the **1970s, 1980s, and 1990s**, which contain the bulk of the most popular festive songs. It is evidence *against* a **2020s** winner, which would need to overcome this massive inertial disadvantage.

*   **Evidence 3: The existence of other major classic contenders.**
    *   The main challengers to Wham! are often cited as The Pogues' "Fairytale of New York" (1987) and Mariah Carey's "All I Want for Christmas Is You" (1994).
    *   The Pogues' song strengthens the case for the **1980s**, as it provides an alternative winner within the same decade.
    *   Mariah Carey's song is the single most likely path to victory for the **1990s**. Its global streaming power is immense, making a 90s win a very plausible alternative.

*   **Evidence 4: The potential for a new, organized campaign.**
    *   This is the primary evidence supporting a **2020s** win. The success of LadBaby proved that a well-organized social media or charity campaign can beat the streaming classics. The possibility that a new personality or cause will emerge to fill this role cannot be dismissed. However, the research report notes a lack of early signals for such a campaign, which slightly weakens this possibility.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

Let's start with a softened prior based on the Post-LadBaby era, acknowledging the small sample size:
*   **Prior:** 1980s: 70%, 1990s: 10%, 2020s: 10%, Other: 10%.

Now, let's update based on the evidence of strong alternative classic contenders (Evidence 3). The fact that Mariah Carey (1994) is a perennial top contender and a plausible alternative to an 80s song means the 1990s have a significant chance. This evidence suggests we should shift some probability mass from the 1980s to the 1990s.

*   **Update Step:** The prior odds of 1980s vs 1990s are 70:10 or 7:1. The evidence that Mariah Carey is a top-tier challenger suggests this ratio is too high. A likelihood ratio P(E_Mariah | H_90s) / P(E_Mariah | H_80s) greater than 1 would lower the odds. Let's adjust the odds to be closer to 2:1, reflecting that the 80s have two top-tier candidates (Wham!, The Pogues) to the 90s' one.
*   **Posterior (after this step):** This leads to a distribution where the 1980s probability is roughly double that of the 1990s. For example: 1980s: ~45%, 1990s: ~20%.

The possibility of a new campaign (Evidence 4) keeps the 2020s probability significant, while the general streaming inertia (Evidence 2) gives small but non-zero chances to other classic decades.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My forecast is heavily weighted towards the 1980s, based on a very recent (n=2) trend. The biggest blind spot is underestimating the public and media's desire for novelty. After three consecutive years of "Last Christmas" at the top (2023, 2024, and likely much of the 2025 season), a narrative could easily build around "Let's get a *new* song to number one," which would strongly favor a 2020s release. The LadBaby model has proven this is possible. My 15% allocation to the 2020s is an attempt to account for this, but a successful campaign could make that look far too low. The best alternative forecast would place the 2020s as the favorite (~40%), arguing that the market abhors a vacuum and a new novelty act is the most likely entity to fill it. However, I maintain that inertia is a stronger force than the unproven potential of a yet-to-emerge challenger.

### 6. Final Normalization

After considering the base rates, evidence, and red team challenges, I have distributed the probabilities as follows, ensuring they sum to 100%.

*   **1980s (45%):** The highest probability, reflecting the incumbent winner ("Last Christmas," 1984) and the strongest challenger ("Fairytale of New York," 1987). This is the default outcome in the current market.
*   **1990s (20%):** Primarily for Mariah Carey's "All I Want for Christmas Is You" (1994), the most powerful streaming classic outside of the 1980s.
*   **2020s (15%):** Represents the significant possibility of a new, successful novelty/charity/social media campaign emerging to break the pattern of classic winners.
*   **1970s (8%):** Accounts for other major classics like Slade and Wizzard, which have high streaming numbers but are less likely to be the focus of a specific campaign.
*   **2000s & 2010s (5% each):** These decades are in a "dead zone" - not old enough to be classics, not new enough to be contemporary. A win is possible but unlikely.
*   **1960s or earlier (2%):** A small chance for a song like Brenda Lee's "Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree" (1958) to have a moment.
