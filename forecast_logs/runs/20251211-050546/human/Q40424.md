### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Judicial Resignations in Pakistan (Normal Period):** In a typical two-month period without a major constitutional crisis, the number of resignations from the superior judiciary is extremely low, effectively zero. Judges typically serve until their mandatory retirement age. Resignation is a rare act of protest or due to personal reasons, not a regular occurrence. **Base Rate: ~0 judges.**
2.  **Judicial Response to Major Pakistani Constitutional Crises:** The most relevant reference class is the 2007-2008 judicial crisis under General Pervez Musharraf. When Musharraf declared a state of emergency and issued a Provisional Constitutional Order (PCO), he demanded judges retake their oaths. Over 60 judges, including a majority of the Supreme Court, refused and were subsequently dismissed. While these were *removals* for non-compliance rather than *resignations*, it represents the closest analogue of a mass judicial protest. This event suggests that in a severe crisis, a significant number of judges (in that case, ~35-40% of the superior judiciary) are willing to lose their positions on principle. **Base Rate (for judges leaving their posts in protest): 10-60 judges.**
3.  **Judicial Purges/Protests in Other Hybrid Regimes:** In countries experiencing democratic backsliding (e.g., Turkey, Hungary, Poland), executives have moved to control the judiciary. Responses have varied. In Turkey (2016), thousands of judges were dismissed/arrested post-coup attempt. In Poland, judges have protested and faced disciplinary action but mass resignations have not been the primary tool of resistance. This class suggests that mass resignations are a less common response than external protest or forced removal. **Base Rate: 1-5 judges.**

*Limitations:* The 2007 crisis involved an extra-constitutional military action, whereas the current event is a formal (though contentious) constitutional amendment, creating a different legal and political context for judges. The current situation is a unique shock.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-11-13** 27th Amendment passed and signed into law. — **↑ (Large)** — The primary trigger event, representing an existential threat to judicial independence and prompting immediate reactions.
*   **2025-11-13** SC Justices Mansoor Ali Shah and Athar Minallah resign. — **↑ (Large)** — Establishes a credible precedent by senior, respected judges, signaling that resignation is a legitimate and principled response.
*   **2025-11-14** Lahore HC Justice Shams Mehmood Mirza resigns. — **↑ (Moderate)** — Demonstrates that the sentiment extends beyond the Supreme Court to the larger High Courts, increasing the pool of potential resignations.
*   **2025-11-15** Opposition alliance TTAP calls for nationwide protests. — **↑ (Small)** — Creates a political atmosphere supportive of judicial defiance, but the opposition's ability to mobilize is uncertain and may not directly influence judicial decisions.
*   **2025-11-15 to 2025-12-10** No further resignations reported from superior courts. — **↓ (Large)** — This is a critical piece of evidence. The nearly four-week gap since the initial wave suggests the momentum for a mass resignation has stalled and a collective action has not materialized.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Judicial Cohesion & Principled Stand:** The degree to which judges act in a coordinated manner based on a shared belief that the amendment is an intolerable assault on the rule of law. A "domino effect" following the first resignations is the primary upward driver. (Size: Large)
2.  **Government Coercion & Incentives:** The government can use threats (investigations, security risks) or inducements (appointments to the new Constitutional Court, protection of pensions) to discourage resignations and encourage compliance. (Size: Large)
3.  **"Fight from Within" Mentality:** A belief among some judges that it is their duty to remain in their posts to mitigate damage, interpret the new laws, and resist from inside the system rather than ceding the entire judiciary to the executive. (Size: Moderate)
4.  **Bar Associations & Civil Society Pressure:** Strong, unified calls for resignation from the Pakistan Bar Council and provincial bar associations could embolden more judges to step down, recreating the spirit of the 2007 Lawyers' Movement. (Size: Moderate)
5.  **Personal Financial & Career Considerations:** Most superior court judges are near the end of their careers. Resigning means forgoing a prestigious position, salary, and pension benefits, a significant personal disincentive. (Size: Moderate)
6.  **Perception of Futility:** If judges believe their resignation will be a symbolic but ultimately ineffective gesture that will simply allow the government to appoint more compliant replacements, they may choose to stay. (Size: Small)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Constitutional Veneer vs. Military Coup:** Unlike the 2007 crisis (extra-constitutional PCO), this action was passed as a constitutional amendment. This provides a fig leaf of legality, making a collective judicial refusal more complex than simply declining an unconstitutional oath.
*   **Targeted vs. Wholesale Change:** The 2007 crisis was a blunt removal of non-compliant judges. The 27th Amendment is a structural overhaul, creating new institutions and powers (like forced transfers). This may encourage a "wait-and-see" approach from judges to see how these new powers are implemented.
*   **Immediate Senior Resignations:** The current crisis began with the voluntary resignation of two of the most senior and respected SC judges. This is a powerful moral statement that differs from the 2007 scenario, which was initiated by the executive's mass dismissal.
*   **Fragmented Political Opposition:** The opposition is led by an imprisoned Imran Khan, and its ability to sustain a mass movement comparable to the 2007 Lawyers' Movement is questionable, reducing external pressure and support for defiant judges.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with the 2007 crisis as a weak prior, suggesting a wide distribution centered around 5-15 resignations/removals (equivalent n≈3), acknowledging the severity of the shock.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   **↑ (Large):** The amendment's extreme nature and the immediate resignation of three judges (two from the SC) strongly update the probability away from zero and into the realm of a genuine crisis.
    *   **↓ (Large):** The subsequent ~4-week period of inaction with no further resignations is powerful counter-evidence, suggesting that the initial shock did not trigger a sustained cascade. This should significantly pull the estimate down from the high end of the crisis range.
    *   **↓ (Moderate):** The "constitutional amendment" framing provides cover for judges who choose to stay, unlike the clear-cut illegality of the 2007 PCO.
    *   **↑ (Small):** Calls for protest from the opposition provide a supportive environment but are unlikely to be the deciding factor for judges themselves.
*   **Net effect:** The initial evidence pointed towards a potential mass resignation event. However, the lack of follow-through is the most salient fact. The posterior should be revised significantly downwards from a high-crisis estimate, to a number just slightly above the three resignations already observed.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   A collective statement from a group of High Court or Supreme Court judges threatening to resign.
    *   The Pakistan Bar Council or a major provincial bar council formally calling for judges to resign.
    *   The government attempting to use the new transfer power, potentially triggering a resignation in protest.
    *   Large-scale, sustained street protests that create a groundswell of public support for judicial defiance.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   A statement from the Chief Justice of Pakistan urging judges to remain and work within the new framework.
    *   Judges accepting nominations or appointments to the new Federal Constitutional Court.
    *   The initial protests called by the TTAP fizzling out with low attendance.
    *   Business as usual: courts continuing to hear routine cases under the new structure without further comment.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Definitional Ambiguity:** The resolution criteria specifies "resign." A judge who is transferred, refuses the transfer, and is then dismissed might not be counted, though it is functionally a protest departure.
*   **Information Lag:** Resignations may occur but not be publicly reported for several days. Given the short time remaining (until Dec 31), this lag is a risk.
*   **Time Horizon:** The question is limited to Nov-Dec 2025. A coordinated wave of resignations could be planned for early January 2026, which would resolve this question at the current number but misrepresent the full scale of the judicial response.
*   **Unseen Negotiations:** Back-channel negotiations between the government/military and senior judiciary could be occurring to de-escalate the crisis, the results of which are not yet public.

**Final Research Summary:**
The constitutional amendment created a severe shock, prompting three principled, high-profile resignations. However, the subsequent lack of further departures is strong evidence that a mass judicial walkout has failed to materialize, with most judges likely opting to remain for personal or strategic reasons.

To produce a probabilistic forecast for the number of judges on Pakistan's Superior Courts who will resign during late 2025, we will follow the structured Bayesian reasoning process:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - **Base Rate 1:** In normal periods, judicial resignations are rare, effectively zero. This provides a baseline of ~0 resignations.
   - **Base Rate 2:** During the 2007-2008 crisis, a significant number of judges (~35-40% of the superior judiciary) left their positions, suggesting a potential range of 10-60 judges in extreme crisis situations.
   - **Base Rate 3:** In other hybrid regimes, mass resignations are less common, suggesting a range of 1-5 judges.
   - **Chosen Base Rate:** Given the current context, a base rate centered around 5-15 resignations/removals is appropriate, acknowledging the severity of the shock but also the differences from the 2007 crisis.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - **Similarities:** The current situation involves a significant constitutional change, similar to past crises.
   - **Differences:** The current amendment is a formal constitutional change, not an extra-constitutional action, which may reduce the likelihood of mass resignations.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **↑ (Large):** The amendment's extreme nature and the immediate resignation of three judges suggest a potential for more resignations.
   - **↓ (Large):** The lack of further resignations over four weeks indicates a stall in momentum.
   - **↓ (Moderate):** The constitutional framing provides a legal cover for judges to remain.
   - **↑ (Small):** Political protests create a supportive environment but are unlikely to be decisive.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - **Prior:** Centered around 5-15 resignations.
   - **Update:** The initial resignations increased the likelihood of more resignations, but the subsequent lack of action significantly reduces this probability.
   - **Posterior:** The distribution shifts towards a lower number of resignations, slightly above the three already observed.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the possibility of unseen negotiations or delayed resignations.
   - **Alternative Scenario:** A coordinated resignation wave in early 2026 could misrepresent the scale of the response.
   - **Adjustment:** Account for potential information lag and unseen negotiations.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Based on the analysis, the forecast is adjusted to reflect the most likely outcomes given the evidence and potential uncertainties.

P10: 3  
P20: 3  
P40: 4  
P60: 5  
P80: 6  
P90: 8

# Forecasting Judicial Resignations in Pakistan (Late 2025)

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this forecast, I'll consider several reference classes:

1. **Normal judicial resignation rate in Pakistan**: Typically near zero in a two-month period. Judges usually serve until retirement.

2. **2007-2008 Pakistani judicial crisis**: When Musharraf declared emergency rule, approximately 60 judges were removed or resigned in protest. This represents an upper bound for judicial protest.

3. **Recent constitutional crisis (Nov 2025)**: Three judges have already resigned (two Supreme Court, one High Court) in direct response to the 27th Amendment.

I'll use a composite prior centered around 5 resignations, with a wide variance (1-15) to reflect uncertainty, giving more weight to the current crisis than historical patterns.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to reference cases**:
- Like 2007, this is a constitutional crisis threatening judicial independence
- The amendment creates mechanisms for executive control of the judiciary
- Initial resignations signal principled opposition

**Key differences**:
- Unlike 2007, this change has constitutional legitimacy (passed as an amendment)
- The initial wave of resignations (3) occurred immediately but has not continued
- Four weeks have passed without additional resignations
- The opposition is weaker than during the 2007 Lawyers' Movement

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence for higher resignations**:
- The amendment fundamentally alters judicial independence (+2x likelihood)
- Two Supreme Court justices resigned immediately, setting a precedent (+1.5x)
- A High Court judge followed suit, showing broader judicial concern (+1.2x)
- Opposition calling for nationwide protests may embolden judges (+1.1x)

**Evidence for lower resignations**:
- No additional resignations in ~4 weeks since the initial wave (÷3x likelihood)
- Constitutional veneer provides legal cover for judges who stay (÷1.5x)
- Personal financial considerations (pensions, career) discourage resignation (÷1.3x)
- "Fight from within" mentality may be prevalent among remaining judges (÷1.2x)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior centered at 5 resignations:

**First update** - Initial wave of 3 resignations:
- This confirms the crisis is serious enough to prompt principled resignations
- Increases my estimate to 7-8 resignations (shifts distribution upward)

**Second update** - Four weeks with no further resignations:
- This is strong evidence against a mass resignation event
- Significantly reduces my estimate to 4-5 resignations
- Narrows the distribution (reduces variance)

**Third update** - Constitutional legitimacy vs. 2007 crisis:
- The amendment's formal legality makes mass resignations less likely
- Further reduces my estimate to 3-4 resignations

The posterior distribution is now centered around 3-4 resignations, with reduced variance compared to my prior.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots**:
- I may be overweighting the "no further resignations" evidence; judges might be coordinating behind the scenes
- The holiday period (December) might be strategically chosen for a wave of resignations
- Bar associations could still mobilize significant pressure on judges

**Alternative scenarios**:
- A coordinated mass resignation (10+ judges) could still occur if a triggering event happens
- The government might use its new transfer powers, prompting additional resignations
- Protests could grow, creating public pressure for judicial defiance

**Adjustments**:
- I'll widen my distribution slightly to account for these possibilities
- I'll shift my P80-P90 values upward to reflect potential tail risks

## 6. Final Percentiles

After considering all evidence and potential scenarios, my forecast distribution for the number of judges on Pakistan's Superior Courts who will resign during late 2025:

P10: 3
P20: 3
P40: 4
P60: 5
P80: 7
P90: 10

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The target variable is the number of judicial resignations during a specific two-month constitutional crisis period. A simple base rate of resignations in a normal period (which is near zero) is inappropriate due to the extraordinary circumstances. The most relevant reference class is the **2007-2008 Pakistani judicial crisis**.

*   **Reference Class:** During the 2007 crisis, General Musharraf's extra-constitutional order led to the dismissal of over 60 judges from the superior courts who refused to take a new oath. This represents a mass departure of judges (~35-40% of the judiciary at the time) on a matter of principle.
*   **Prior Distribution:** While the 2007 event involved dismissals, not resignations, it establishes that a large-scale judicial protest involving dozens of judges is possible in Pakistan. This suggests a very wide prior distribution for the number of judges who might leave their posts. A reasonable prior might be centered around **10-20 judges**, with a large variance and a long right tail, acknowledging the possibility of a much larger number (like 40-60) or a much smaller one.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

The current situation differs from the 2007 crisis in ways that are crucial for the forecast.

*   **Similarities:** Both events represent a fundamental challenge by the executive/military to judicial independence, creating a clear point of conflict.
*   **Differences:**
    *   **Mechanism:** The current changes are enacted via a formal (though highly controversial) **constitutional amendment**, not an extra-constitutional military decree. This "veneer of legality" makes a collective, principled refusal more complex than in 2007, likely reducing the number of resignations.
    *   **Action:** This crisis involves voluntary **resignation**, which requires more individual agency and sacrifice (giving up a post, pension, etc.) than being **dismissed** for refusing an unconstitutional order. This also points toward a lower number.
    *   **Trigger:** The 2007 crisis forced a simultaneous decision on all judges (take the oath or be dismissed). The current amendment is a structural change, allowing for individual, staggered decisions. This makes a single, massive wave of protest less likely.

These differences suggest that while the 2007 crisis provides a useful upper bound on the scale of judicial protest, the final number of *resignations* in this instance will likely be significantly lower.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will update the prior based on the specific events of November-December 2025.

*   **Evidence 1: The 27th Amendment's passage and its radical nature.** This is a severe shock to the judicial system. This evidence strongly supports a higher number of resignations and makes outcomes far above zero much more likely. **(Pushes forecast UP significantly)**.
*   **Evidence 2: The immediate resignation of two senior Supreme Court justices and one High Court justice (Nov 13-14).** This is a powerful signal. It establishes resignation as a credible and principled response, creating the potential for a "domino effect" or cascade of further resignations. **(Pushes forecast UP significantly)**.
*   **Evidence 3: The period of inaction from November 15 to December 10.** This is the most critical piece of evidence. Nearly four weeks have passed since the initial wave with no further resignations from the superior courts. This is strong evidence *against* the cascade hypothesis. It suggests that the momentum for a mass resignation has stalled and that a collective action has failed to materialize. **(Pushes forecast DOWN very significantly)**.

The net effect is that early evidence pointed towards a potentially large number of resignations, but the most recent (and longest) period of evidence strongly pulls the forecast back down, anchoring it near the number of resignations already observed.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

*   **Prior:** A wide distribution centered around 10-20, informed by the 2007 crisis.
*   **Update 1 (Amendment + Initial 3 Resignations):** The prior is updated. The probability of 0-2 resignations becomes zero. The likelihood of a high number (20+) increases substantially, as a crisis is confirmed. The median of the distribution shifts upwards.
*   **Update 2 (The ~4-week Lull):** This new evidence has a high likelihood under a "low final number" hypothesis and a very low likelihood under a "mass resignation" hypothesis. Applying Bayes' rule, this evidence dramatically reduces the probability of high-end outcomes. The posterior distribution becomes heavily concentrated at the low end, anchored by the three resignations that have already occurred.
*   **Posterior Shape:** The resulting posterior distribution is no longer wide. It has a mode at 3 (the current number). The median is also likely to be very close to 3, reflecting a >50% probability that no more judges will resign. The distribution has a right skew, acknowledging the small but non-zero chance that a few more judges resign individually before the end of the year.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

*   **Main Blind Spot:** Am I overweighting the "lull"? A coordinated wave of resignations could be planned for a later date in December to maximize impact (e.g., to coincide with the seating of the new Constitutional Court). This "delayed fuse" scenario is a key tail risk.
*   **Alternative Forecast:** A plausible alternative is a "slow trickle" where another 3-5 judges resign individually over the next few weeks as they weigh their options or are targeted by the new transfer powers. This would result in a final count of 6-8. This is a more moderate scenario than a large wave but higher than my central estimate.
*   **Rebuttal & Adjustment:** The "delayed fuse" seems less likely because political momentum is crucial and has likely dissipated. The "slow trickle" is more plausible. My forecast must account for this by having a sufficiently heavy tail. My central estimate remains low because the path of least resistance for most judges is to stay, and the window for a powerful, collective statement appears to have closed. I will ensure my P80 and P90 percentiles are high enough to reflect the "slow trickle" possibility.

### 6. Final Percentiles

My final distribution is anchored at the 3 resignations that have already occurred. I assign a greater than 50% chance that no more judges will resign. The median is therefore 3. The upper percentiles account for the small possibility of a "slow trickle" of a few more individual resignations before the year's end.

P10: 3
P20: 3
P40: 3
P60: 4
P80: 5
P90: 7
