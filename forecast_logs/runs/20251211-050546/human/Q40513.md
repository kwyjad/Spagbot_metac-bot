### Reference class & base rates
-   **Reference Class 1: Years with a Continuing Resolution (CR) extending into the next calendar year.** In modern, polarized Congresses, it is common for appropriations to be incomplete by the start of the fiscal year (Oct 1). When a CR is passed that pushes the final deadline past January 1, the period between the CR's passage and the holiday recess is typically legislatively quiet on appropriations. The incentive to complete work is low, as the immediate crisis has been averted.
    -   **Base Rate:** The number of additional regular appropriations bills passed in December after a CR is enacted to fund the government into the next calendar year is very low, historically averaging close to **0**.
-   **Reference Class 2: Lame-duck sessions after a midterm election.** While this is not a lame-duck session, the dynamic of finishing essential business before a long recess is similar. In these sessions, action is often binary: either a massive omnibus package is passed to clear the decks, or a simple CR is passed to punt the issue. The current situation is a hybrid; a partial resolution was achieved, and the rest was punted.
    -   **Base Rate:** In cases where a punt (via a CR) is the chosen path, the base rate of passing *more* individual bills before recess is again near **0**.
-   **Limitations:** The specific context of a historically long shutdown immediately preceding this period is unusual. This could increase political fatigue (favoring inaction) or create a backlash-driven desire to demonstrate functionality (favoring action), making historical comparisons less reliable.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
-   **2025-11-08 (approx.)** CR passed, three bills enacted — **↓** — The deal ended the shutdown, passed the least controversial bills (Ag, Leg Branch, MilCon-VA), and extended funding for the remaining nine agencies to Jan 30, 2026. This removed all immediate pressure to act before year-end.
-   **2025-11-01 (approx.)** Historic government shutdown ends — **↓** — The month-long shutdown was politically costly and consumed significant political capital. Leadership is likely exhausted and hesitant to immediately re-engage in another high-stakes fiscal fight before the holidays.
-   **2025-08-01** Senate passes a "minibus" of three bills — **(neutral)** — The sources show that the three enacted bills were processed and passed by the Senate as a package in the summer. This demonstrates a prior ability to bundle non-controversial bills, but is not new information relative to their final enactment in November.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
-   **Deadline Proximity:** The primary driver for appropriations action is a hard deadline. The November deal pushed the next "fiscal cliff" to January 30, 2026, completely removing any incentive for action in December 2025. (Size: Large)
-   **Holiday Recess:** The congressional calendar in December is dominated by the desire to adjourn for the holidays. The procedural complexity and negotiation time required for the remaining nine bills is incompatible with the short, pre-recess legislative window. (Size: Large)
-   **Bill Controversy Level:** The three enacted bills are consistently among the least controversial. The remaining nine include the most contentious bills, such as Defense (funding levels), Labor-HHS-Education (policy riders), and Homeland Security (border policy), which require protracted and difficult negotiations. (Size: Moderate)
-   **Political Will & Fatigue:** After a bruising and historically long shutdown, the appetite for further conflict is likely very low among all parties. The path of least resistance is to adhere to the established CR timeline and reconvene on these issues in January. (Size: Moderate)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
-   **Partial Success Achieved:** Unlike a simple "kick the can" CR, the November deal included the passage of three full-year bills. This clears the easiest work off the agenda, concentrating all remaining political friction into the outstanding, more difficult bills.
-   **Extreme Political Polarization:** The context is a government that just endured the "longest federal government shutdown in US history." This suggests that the underlying disagreements on the remaining bills are exceptionally deep, making a quick, quiet resolution in December highly improbable.
-   **Known Outcome:** The question resolves on Jan 1, 2026, but the operative deadline for the remaining bills is Jan 30, 2026. There is no ambiguity or external pressure forcing a resolution before the end of the calendar year. The path forward has already been negotiated.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
-   **Prior:** The base rate suggests that no additional bills will pass before 2026. A strong prior should be centered on the **3** bills already enacted, with a very low probability of any additional bills passing. (Equivalent n: ~15, reflecting high confidence from historical precedent).
-   **Evidence mapping:**
    -   (↓ Large) The CR extends the deadline to Jan 30, 2026, removing the primary driver for action.
    -   (↓ Large) The impending holiday recess provides a powerful incentive to defer complex legislative work.
    -   (↓ Moderate) The remaining nine bills are the most controversial, making a quick deal impossible.
    -   (↓ Moderate) Political fatigue following a historic shutdown reduces the appetite for another immediate fiscal battle.
-   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly reinforces the prior. The posterior distribution should be even more sharply peaked at exactly **3** bills. The probability of any number other than 3 should be considered extremely low.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
-   **UP indicators:**
    -   Public statements from the Speaker, Senate Majority Leader, and White House announcing a breakthrough or a "Christmas surprise" deal.
    -   House or Senate leadership scheduling floor time for an appropriations minibus or omnibus before the holiday recess.
    -   Credible media reports of intense, around-the-clock negotiations between the four corners of congressional leadership.
-   **DOWN indicators:**
    -   Congressional leadership announcing the schedule for holiday recess with no mention of appropriations.
    -   Public statements from leadership confirming that appropriations will be the first order of business in January.
    -   Congress adjourning for the year.

### Caveats & pitfalls
-   **Unpredictable Events:** A sudden, major national security or economic crisis could force Congress to pass an emergency supplemental bill, to which leaders might attach the remaining appropriations bills.
-   **Definitional Gotcha:** The resolution depends on the CRS appropriations table. While unlikely, any delay in updating this official source could affect the resolution if a bill were signed into law on December 31st.
-   **Political Grandstanding:** A party could force a vote on an appropriations package for messaging purposes, though passage would be highly unlikely. This could create misleading headlines.
-   **Complexity of Remaining Bills:** The nine remaining bills are not a monolith. It is theoretically possible, though improbable, that a deal is reached on one or two of the less-controversial remaining bills (e.g., Energy & Water, Financial Services), but this is highly unlikely given the lack of a deadline.

Final Research Summary: Three appropriations bills were already enacted in November. With the next deadline pushed to late January 2026 and the holiday recess imminent, there is virtually no incentive or time for Congress to negotiate and pass any of the nine remaining, more controversial bills before the new year.

To produce a probabilistic forecast for the number of FY 2026 regular appropriations bills enacted before 2026, we'll follow the structured Bayesian reasoning process:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - **Reference Class 1:** Years with a CR extending into the next calendar year. Historically, very few additional bills are passed in December after such a CR, with an average close to 0.
   - **Reference Class 2:** Lame-duck sessions after a midterm election, where the base rate of passing more individual bills before recess is near 0.
   - **Chosen Base Rate:** Given the current situation aligns with both reference classes, the base rate is centered around 3 bills already enacted, with a very low probability for additional bills. Mean = 3, Variance = low.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - **Similarity:** The situation mirrors past years where a CR extends into the next year, and the legislative focus shifts away from appropriations.
   - **Difference:** The recent historic shutdown could either increase fatigue (favoring inaction) or spur action to demonstrate functionality, though the latter is less likely given the evidence.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **CR Extension:** Strongly suggests no further bills will pass before 2026 (↓ Large).
   - **Holiday Recess:** Further reduces the likelihood of additional bills (↓ Large).
   - **Controversial Bills Remaining:** Makes quick resolution unlikely (↓ Moderate).
   - **Political Fatigue:** Reduces the appetite for further conflict (↓ Moderate).

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - **Prior:** Centered at 3 bills, reflecting historical precedent.
   - **Likelihoods:** Strongly reinforce the prior, suggesting no additional bills will pass.
   - **Posterior:** Sharply peaked at 3 bills, with very low probability for any other outcome.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - **Tail Risks:** Consider the possibility of an emergency forcing action, though unlikely.
   - **Alternative Scenarios:** A sudden breakthrough deal is possible but improbable.
   - **Adjustment:** Given the strong evidence and lack of contrary indicators, the forecast remains centered at 3 bills.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Given the strong alignment of evidence with the prior, the percentiles reflect a high confidence in no additional bills passing before 2026.

P10: 3  
P20: 3  
P40: 3  
P60: 3  
P80: 3  
P90: 3

# Forecast: How many of the 12 FY 2026 regular appropriations bills will be enacted before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I'll use two key reference classes:

1. **Years with a CR extending into the next calendar year**: When Congress passes a CR that extends funding into January, the historical pattern shows very few additional appropriations bills are passed in December. The base rate is approximately 0 additional bills passed after a CR is enacted that extends into the next calendar year.

2. **Post-shutdown recovery periods**: After a government shutdown ends with a CR, Congress typically does not immediately return to appropriations battles before the next deadline.

Given the background information, we already know that 3 bills have been enacted (Agriculture, Legislative Branch, and Military Construction-VA). The question is how many total bills will be enacted before 2026, so our prior should be centered on 3 bills.

Prior distribution mean: 3 bills
Prior distribution variance: Very low (highly concentrated at exactly 3)

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- A CR has been passed extending funding into January 2026, removing immediate pressure
- The easiest/least controversial bills have already been enacted
- Congress typically avoids complex legislative work before holiday recess

**Differences from base case:**
- This shutdown was historically long (over a month), which might create even stronger aversion to reopening appropriations discussions
- Three bills have already been enacted, which is somewhat unusual (often it's either 0 or all 12)
- The remaining 9 bills include the most contentious ones (Defense, Labor-HHS-Education, Homeland Security)

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence for additional bills being enacted:**
- None apparent in the provided information

**Evidence against additional bills being enacted:**
- The CR extends to January 30, 2026, completely removing deadline pressure (strong downward factor, ~10:1 likelihood ratio)
- The holiday recess is approaching, limiting legislative calendar time (strong downward factor, ~5:1 likelihood ratio)
- The remaining 9 bills are the most controversial, requiring complex negotiations (moderate downward factor, ~3:1 likelihood ratio)
- Political fatigue after the longest shutdown in US history reduces appetite for immediate fiscal battles (moderate downward factor, ~2:1 likelihood ratio)

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with a prior strongly centered on 3 bills, I'll update based on the evidence:

Prior: P(3 bills) ≈ 0.9, P(>3 bills) ≈ 0.1

Likelihood ratio for observing no additional bills given the evidence:
- CR extending to January 30 (10:1)
- Holiday recess approaching (5:1)
- Remaining bills being controversial (3:1)
- Political fatigue (2:1)

Combined likelihood ratio: ~300:1 against additional bills

Posterior calculation:
P(3 bills | evidence) = P(evidence | 3 bills) × P(3 bills) / P(evidence)
∝ 300 × 0.9 / (300 × 0.9 + 1 × 0.1)
≈ 0.9996

This posterior is extremely concentrated at exactly 3 bills, with negligible probability mass on other outcomes.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

Potential blind spots in my analysis:

1. **Emergency legislation**: A national security or economic crisis could force Congress to pass emergency legislation to which appropriations bills might be attached.

2. **Political incentives**: There might be political advantages to demonstrating functionality after a historic shutdown that I'm not accounting for.

3. **Overconfidence**: Historical patterns might not fully apply to this unprecedented situation.

4. **Partial progress**: It's possible that 1-2 of the less controversial remaining bills could be negotiated separately.

However, even considering these factors, the evidence against additional bills is overwhelming:
- The CR explicitly extends to January 30, 2026
- The holiday recess is imminent
- The remaining bills are the most controversial
- There's no deadline pressure until late January

I'll slightly adjust my distribution to account for these possibilities, but maintain a strong concentration at 3 bills.

## 6. Final Percentiles

P10: 3
P20: 3
P40: 3
P60: 3
P80: 3
P90: 3

Here is my probabilistic forecast.

**1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
The target variable is the number of appropriations bills enacted in a short, specific window (December 11-31) after a continuing resolution (CR) has already pushed the next major deadline into the following year.

-   **Reference Class:** The most appropriate reference class is the legislative behavior of the U.S. Congress in December when a CR is in place that funds the government into the next calendar year.
-   **Base Rate:** In these situations, the primary driver for legislative action on appropriations—a hard deadline—is absent. Combined with the impending holiday recess, the historical base rate for passing *additional* complex and controversial appropriations bills during this period is extremely low, averaging near zero.
-   **Prior Distribution:** My prior is therefore strongly centered on the number of bills already enacted, which is 3. The distribution assumes a very high probability that no additional bills will be passed. The mean, median, and mode of this prior distribution are all 3.

**2. Comparison to Base Case**
-   **Similarities:** The current situation aligns perfectly with the reference class. A CR is in effect until January 30, 2026, removing any immediate pressure. The holiday recess is imminent, drastically shortening the legislative calendar and reducing the appetite for work. The bills that have already passed (Agriculture, Leg. Branch, MilCon-VA) are typically the least controversial, leaving the most difficult ones for later, which is a common pattern.
-   **Differences:** The primary unique factor is that this period follows the "longest federal government shutdown in US history." This extreme event likely exacerbates the conditions of the base case rather than countering them. The political polarization that caused the shutdown is still present, and lawmakers are likely experiencing significant political fatigue. This makes a quick, cooperative resolution to the remaining contentious bills even less likely than in a typical year.

**3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
All available evidence points towards no additional bills being enacted before 2026.

-   **CR Deadline (Jan 30, 2026):** This is the strongest piece of evidence. It removes the primary forcing mechanism for action. This makes the outcome of "0 additional bills" vastly more likely than any other outcome. (Strongly pushes forecast down, i.e., towards no change from 3).
-   **Holiday Recess:** The congressional calendar provides almost no time for the complex negotiations, drafting, and floor procedures required to pass appropriations bills. This provides a powerful incentive to defer action. (Strongly pushes forecast down).
-   **Bill Controversy:** The nine remaining bills include the most contentious ones (e.g., Defense, Labor-HHS, Homeland Security). These require significant time and political capital to resolve, neither of which is available. (Moderately pushes forecast down).
-   **Political Fatigue:** Coming off a historic shutdown, the appetite for another high-stakes fiscal fight is near zero. The path of least resistance is to adjourn for the holidays and address the issue in January as planned. (Moderately pushes forecast down).

**4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
-   **Conceptual Update:** Posterior ∝ Prior × Likelihood.
-   My prior was already strongly concentrated at 3 enacted bills. Every significant piece of evidence acts as a strong multiplier for the likelihood of this outcome. The CR deadline, the holiday schedule, and the political context all suggest that the probability of passing 0 additional bills is extremely high.
-   **Update Step:** If my prior belief was P(Total=3) = 90%, the overwhelming and uniformly negative evidence would increase this confidence significantly. For example, if the combined likelihood ratio of the evidence in favor of "0 additional bills" vs. ">0 additional bills" is 10:1, the posterior odds become (0.9/0.1) * 10 = 90:1, which translates to a posterior probability P(Total=3) of approximately 98.9%.
-   **Posterior Shape:** The posterior distribution is even more sharply peaked at the integer value of 3 than the prior was. The probability mass for any value greater than 3 is exceptionally small.

**5. Red Team Thinking**
-   **Alternative Scenario:** What if a "Christmas Miracle" omnibus deal is reached to avoid another shutdown fight in January? Leaders, chastened by the historic shutdown, could secretly negotiate a grand bargain to pass all 9 remaining bills.
-   **Plausibility:** This is extremely unlikely. The political divisions are too deep, and a deal of this magnitude would require time and trust that do not exist. There are no leading indicators (media reports, leadership statements) to support this scenario. The logistics of passing such a bill before the recess are also prohibitive.
-   **Other Risks:** A major national security crisis could force an emergency supplemental bill, to which appropriations might be attached. This is a low-probability, high-impact "black swan" event.
-   **Adjustment:** The possibility of such surprise events is real but very small. I estimate the probability of *any* additional bills passing before January 1 is less than 5%, and likely closer to 1-2%. This small probability is concentrated in the far upper tail of the distribution. For the purposes of the P10 through P90 percentiles, the outcome is robustly 3.

**6. Final Percentiles**
My posterior distribution is overwhelmingly concentrated on the outcome of 3. The probability of the total being exactly 3 is well over 95%. As a result, the cumulative probability of the outcome being 3 or less is also well over 95%. This means that all percentiles from the 10th to the 90th fall on the same integer value.

P10: 3
P20: 3
P40: 3
P60: 3
P80: 3
P90: 3
