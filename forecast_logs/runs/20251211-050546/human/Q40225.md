Here is my research plan.

### **Step 1: Identify Core Questions**

1.  **Reference Class & Base Rate:** What is the historical frequency of large-scale, state-ordered evacuations (>100,000 people) of capital cities due to slow-onset environmental disasters (drought, subsidence, pollution)? How does this compare to evacuations for acute disasters (hurricanes, war) or planned capital relocations?
2.  **Recent Developments & Iranian Context:** What specific actions, beyond rhetoric, has the Iranian government taken in the last 6 months regarding Tehran's environmental crises? Have there been budget allocations, parliamentary debates, or official decrees from bodies other than the presidency (e.g., the Supreme Leader's office)? What is the current status of Tehran's water reservoirs and have rationing measures been implemented?
3.  **Mechanisms & Causal Drivers:** What are the primary forces pushing for and against an evacuation order?
    *   **For:** Severity of the environmental crisis, political will of the President, potential for a crisis-forcing function.
    *   **Against:** Logistical and financial capacity of the state, political inertia and resistance from Tehran's elite, the complex power structure of the Islamic Republic (President vs. Supreme Leader/IRGC).
4.  **Distinguishing Factors:** What makes this situation unique compared to the reference class? Key factors include Iran's specific political system, its economic situation under sanctions, and the combination of multiple simultaneous environmental stressors in Tehran.
5.  **Resolution Criteria Analysis:** What constitutes a formal "order" for an "evacuation"? This implies a mandatory, state-directed movement, not a voluntary relocation program or a long-term plan to move administrative functions. The threshold of 100,000 people is significant.

### **Step 2: Propose Search Queries**

1.  **For Reference Class:**
    *   `"capital city evacuation" environmental disaster history`
    *   `"major city evacuation" drought OR "water scarcity" OR subsidence`
    *   `historical government-ordered mass evacuations non-military`
    *   `Jakarta subsidence evacuation plan`
    *   `Mexico City water crisis government response`
    *   `List of relocated capital cities` (for contrast)
2.  **For Recent Developments:**
    *   `Iran "Tehran water crisis" "December 2025" OR "November 2025"`
    *   `"President Pezeshkian" "evacuate Tehran" decree OR order`
    *   `"Supreme Leader" Khamenei on "Tehran relocation" OR "water crisis"`
    *   `IRGC role in "Tehran infrastructure projects" OR "water management"`
    *   `Majles OR Iranian parliament budget "capital relocation" OR "Tehran evacuation"`
3.  **For Mechanisms & Differences:**
    *   `logistics of evacuating a megacity`
    *   `Iran government budget capacity sanctions`
    *   `power of Iranian president versus Supreme Leader`
    *   `political economy of Tehran real estate`
    *   `public opinion Iran "moving capital"`

### **Step 3: Synthesize Key Findings**

*   **Base Rate:** State-ordered, large-scale evacuations of capitals for slow-onset environmental disasters are virtually unprecedented. Evacuations are almost exclusively responses to acute, immediate threats like hurricanes (e.g., New Orleans), industrial accidents (e.g., Chernobyl), or conflict. Planned capital *relocations* (e.g., Brazil, Kazakhstan, Indonesia's plan) are multi-decade, enormously expensive projects and are not "evacuations." The base rate for the specific event in the question is therefore extremely low, near zero.
*   **Recent Developments:** The provided sources show a clear escalation in President Pezeshkian's *rhetoric* between October and December 2025, moving from "relocation is a mandate" to explicitly mentioning a potential "evacuation" linked to rainfall. However, there is no public evidence of corresponding logistical preparations, budget allocations, or, crucially, public endorsement from other power centers like the Supreme Leader or the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). The President's statements appear to be aimed at creating a sense of urgency rather than announcing a concrete, imminent plan.
*   **Mechanisms:** The primary driver for the rhetoric is the undeniable severity of Tehran's environmental crises. However, the countervailing forces are immense. The logistical challenge of moving and housing 100,000 people in under a month is likely beyond the current capacity of the Iranian state, especially given its economic constraints. Politically, a reformist president like Pezeshkian lacks the unilateral authority to enforce such a monumental and disruptive order without the backing of the deep state, which has not been forthcoming.
*   **Differences:** Unlike a unitary state, Iran's power is fragmented. The President's office can issue statements, but implementation of major national projects, especially those with security and massive logistical implications, would require the approval and operational support of the Supreme Leader and the IRGC. This internal political friction is a powerful brake on drastic action.

### **Step 4: Draft the Comprehensive Answer**

---

### **Reference class & base rates**

*   **Large-scale evacuations of capitals for slow-onset disasters:** This is the most relevant class. Historically, state-ordered evacuations of >100,000 people from a capital city due to slow-moving environmental crises like drought or land subsidence are virtually unheard of. The base rate is extremely low, likely <0.1%. States typically respond with mitigation (e.g., water rationing, infrastructure projects) rather than mass population displacement.
*   **Evacuations for acute-onset disasters:** Evacuations are common for predictable, imminent threats like major hurricanes (e.g., New Orleans) or in response to industrial accidents (e.g., Pripyat/Chernobyl) and war. This class is not directly comparable as the trigger is sudden and the threat is immediate, forcing a state's hand.
*   **Planned capital city relocations:** Countries occasionally relocate their administrative capitals (e.g., Brazil, Kazakhstan, Myanmar; Indonesia is planning it). These are multi-decade, multi-billion dollar projects involving the gradual transfer of government functions, not a rapid "evacuation" of the general populace. This highlights the enormous inertia and cost involved.

### **Recent developments (timeline bullets)**

*   [2025-01-07] Iran announces intent to relocate the capital to Makran, citing chronic issues. (↑) — Formalizes a long-standing debate, setting a policy direction.
*   [2025-10-02] President Pezeshkian frames capital relocation as a "mandate," not a choice. (↑) — Signals increased presidential commitment and elevates the issue's political importance.
*   [2025-11-14] Pezeshkian states the government might have to "evacuate Tehran" if drought persists past Nov 21. (↑↑) — Dramatically raises the stakes by introducing the term "evacuate" and setting a soft deadline, shifting the discourse from slow relocation to emergency response.
*   [2025-11-20] Pezeshkian reiterates Iran has "no choice" but to move the capital due to catastrophic drought. (↑) — Reinforces the presidential narrative of inevitability and crisis.
*   [2025-12-10] Pezeshkian again calls for moving the capital, framing it as an urgent necessity. (↑) — Maintains high-level political pressure and media focus on the issue as the end of the year approaches.

### **Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)**

*   **Environmental Crisis Severity (Large ↑):** Tehran's water scarcity, extreme land subsidence (>20cm/year in places), and pollution are objectively severe and worsening. This creates genuine, powerful pressure for some form of drastic action.
*   **Presidential Political Will (Moderate ↑):** President Pezeshkian has staked significant political capital on this issue. His repeated, escalating statements create momentum and make it harder to back down without losing face, potentially forcing a symbolic gesture.
*   **Logistical & Financial Incapacity (Large ↓):** The Iranian state, strained by sanctions and internal economic issues, almost certainly lacks the logistical capacity and financial resources to organize transport, shelter, and services for 100,000 people in a matter of weeks. This is a massive practical barrier.
*   **Bureaucratic & Political Inertia (Large ↓):** Tehran is the center of Iran's economic, political, and cultural life.

To forecast the probability of Iran announcing an evacuation of Tehran before 2026, we will follow the Bayesian reasoning steps outlined.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The base rate for large-scale, state-ordered evacuations of capital cities due to slow-onset environmental disasters is extremely low. Historically, such evacuations are virtually unheard of, with states typically opting for mitigation strategies rather than mass displacement. Therefore, the base rate is near zero, likely less than 0.1%.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
**Similarities:**
- Tehran faces severe environmental stressors, similar to other cities that have considered relocation due to environmental issues.

**Differences:**
- Unlike other cases, there is no precedent for a rapid evacuation due to slow-onset environmental issues. The political and logistical challenges in Iran are significant, with fragmented power structures and economic constraints.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Presidential Rhetoric:** The President has escalated rhetoric about the necessity of moving the capital and mentioned potential evacuation. This increases the probability slightly, as it indicates political will.
  - Likelihood Ratio: Moderate increase (P(E | H) > P(E | ~H))
  
- **Lack of Logistical Preparations:** There is no evidence of logistical preparations or budget allocations for an evacuation, which decreases the probability.
  - Likelihood Ratio: Large decrease (P(E | H) < P(E | ~H))
  
- **Political Fragmentation:** The lack of support from other power centers like the Supreme Leader or IRGC further decreases the probability.
  - Likelihood Ratio: Large decrease (P(E | H) < P(E | ~H))

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Starting with a prior probability near 0.1%, the evidence of increased rhetoric slightly raises the probability, but the lack of logistical preparations and political support significantly lowers it. 

- Prior odds: 0.001
- Likelihood ratio (combined): Let's assume a moderate increase from rhetoric (1.5) and a large decrease from lack of preparations and support (0.1).
- Posterior odds = 0.001 * 1.5 * 0.1 = 0.00015
- Posterior probability = 0.00015 / (1 + 0.00015) ≈ 0.015%

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** The forecast might underestimate the potential for a crisis-forcing function if environmental conditions worsen dramatically.
- **Alternative Scenarios:** A sudden, acute environmental crisis could force an evacuation, but this remains unlikely given current evidence.
- **Rebuttals:** The President's rhetoric could be a precursor to more concrete actions, but without logistical and political backing, this remains speculative.

### 6. Final Forecast
Considering the base rate, evidence, and potential for unforeseen developments, the probability remains very low.

Final: 1%

# Will Iran announce an evacuation of Tehran before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to identify an appropriate base rate for state-ordered evacuations of capital cities due to slow-onset environmental disasters.

Looking at historical precedents:
- Large-scale evacuations (>100,000 people) of capital cities due to slow-onset environmental disasters like drought, subsidence, or pollution are virtually unprecedented.
- Evacuations typically occur for acute disasters (hurricanes, floods, war) rather than chronic environmental problems.
- Planned capital relocations (Brazil, Kazakhstan, Indonesia's plans for Jakarta) are multi-decade projects, not rapid evacuations.

The most appropriate base rate is extremely low, approximately 0.5%. This reflects that such evacuations for slow-onset environmental crises are historically almost non-existent, but not completely impossible given extreme circumstances.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Tehran faces genuine environmental crises (water scarcity, land subsidence, pollution) that make the city increasingly uninhabitable.
- The Iranian government has officially acknowledged these problems and discussed relocation.
- There is high-level political rhetoric about the necessity of moving the capital.

**Differences from base case:**
- The severity of Tehran's environmental crisis appears more acute than typical cases, with President Pezeshkian explicitly linking potential evacuation to a specific rainfall deadline.
- Iran's political system is unique - the President has made strong statements, but implementation would require support from the Supreme Leader and IRGC.
- Iran faces significant economic constraints due to sanctions, limiting its capacity to manage a large-scale evacuation.
- The timeline is extremely compressed (weeks rather than years) compared to typical capital relocations.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence 1: President Pezeshkian's escalating rhetoric**
- P(E|H): If Iran will announce an evacuation, we would expect exactly this kind of escalating rhetoric from the President. Probability ~0.9
- P(E|~H): Even if Iran won't announce an evacuation, such rhetoric could be used to emphasize the crisis and push for other solutions. Probability ~0.4
- Likelihood ratio: 0.9/0.4 = 2.25 (moderately increases probability)

**Evidence 2: Lack of logistical preparations or budget allocations**
- P(E|H): If Iran will announce an evacuation within weeks, we would expect to see evidence of logistical preparations. Probability ~0.2
- P(E|~H): If Iran won't announce an evacuation, we would expect this lack of preparation. Probability ~0.9
- Likelihood ratio: 0.2/0.9 = 0.22 (significantly decreases probability)

**Evidence 3: No public endorsement from Supreme Leader or IRGC**
- P(E|H): If an evacuation will be announced, we would expect some signals of support from other power centers. Probability ~0.3
- P(E|~H): If no evacuation will be announced, this silence is expected. Probability ~0.8
- Likelihood ratio: 0.3/0.8 = 0.375 (moderately decreases probability)

**Evidence 4: Severity of environmental crisis**
- P(E|H): If an evacuation will be announced, we would expect a severe environmental crisis. Probability ~0.95
- P(E|~H): Even without an evacuation, such a crisis could exist but be addressed through other means. Probability ~0.7
- Likelihood ratio: 0.95/0.7 = 1.36 (slightly increases probability)

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)

Starting with prior odds of 0.5%/99.5% = 0.005/0.995 = 0.005025

Updating with Evidence 1 (President's rhetoric):
- Posterior odds = 0.005025 × 2.25 = 0.01131
- Posterior probability = 0.01131/(1 + 0.01131) = 0.0112 or ~1.12%

Updating with Evidence 2 (Lack of preparations):
- Posterior odds = 0.01131 × 0.22 = 0.00249
- Posterior probability = 0.00249/(1 + 0.00249) = 0.00248 or ~0.25%

Updating with Evidence 3 (No endorsement from other power centers):
- Posterior odds = 0.00249 × 0.375 = 0.00093
- Posterior probability = 0.00093/(1 + 0.00093) = 0.00093 or ~0.09%

Updating with Evidence 4 (Severity of crisis):
- Posterior odds = 0.00093 × 1.36 = 0.00126
- Posterior probability = 0.00126/(1 + 0.00126) = 0.00126 or ~0.13%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the severity of Tehran's environmental crisis, which could force action despite logistical challenges.
- The Iranian government might define "evacuation" differently than expected (e.g., a phased relocation labeled as evacuation for political purposes).
- There could be internal political dynamics not visible to outside observers that make an evacuation announcement more likely.

**Alternative scenario:**
The most plausible alternative is that Iran announces a symbolic "evacuation" of a smaller scale (perhaps government offices or specific neighborhoods) to demonstrate action without attempting a full-scale evacuation of 100,000+ people. However, the resolution criteria specifically requires at least 100,000 inhabitants, making this scenario irrelevant.

**Adjustments:**
Given the extremely short timeframe (less than 3 weeks until 2026), the enormous logistical challenges, and Iran's fragmented power structure, I believe my forecast may still be too high. However, I'll adjust slightly upward from 0.13% to 0.2% to account for the possibility of unexpected developments or information asymmetries.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

*   **Reference Class:** The most appropriate reference class is state-ordered, large-scale (>100,000 people) evacuations of capital cities due to slow-onset environmental disasters (e.g., drought, land subsidence, long-term pollution).
*   **Reasoning:** This class is distinct from evacuations for acute threats (hurricanes, war, industrial accidents), which are common but driven by immediate, life-threatening events. It is also distinct from planned, multi-decade capital *relocations* (e.g., Brazil to Brasília, Indonesia's plan for Nusantara), which are gradual and not "evacuations." Historically, no major capital city has been evacuated on short notice for a slow-onset environmental crisis. Governments invariably opt for mitigation, rationing, and infrastructure projects, as the logistical, economic, and political costs of a rapid mass evacuation are prohibitive.
*   **Initial Prior:** The base rate for such an unprecedented event is extremely low. I will set the prior probability at **1%**. This acknowledges that environmental pressures are creating novel challenges for governments globally, but that evacuation remains a radical and historically unused tool for this type of problem. Prior odds are 1:99.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities:** The situation in Tehran fits the reference class perfectly: a megacity capital facing multiple, severe, slow-onset environmental crises (water scarcity, subsidence). The government's response has, for decades, been discussion and mitigation, which is typical.
*   **Differences:** The key difference is the recent, explicit, and escalating rhetoric from the head of state, President Pezeshkian. He has moved the conversation from the abstract "relocation" to the urgent "evacuation" and linked it to a near-term condition (rainfall levels in November). This level of crisis rhetoric from a national leader is highly unusual and distinguishes this case from the historical baseline of simply muddling through.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will evaluate two key pieces of evidence.

*   **Evidence A: Escalating Presidential Rhetoric.** President Pezeshkian has explicitly stated the government might have to "evacuate Tehran."
    *   **P(E | H):** If the government were genuinely planning to announce an evacuation, we would expect the President to prepare the public with exactly this kind of dire warning. The likelihood of this evidence, given the hypothesis is true, is high. P(E|H) ≈ 0.9.
    *   **P(E | ~H):** If the government is *not* planning an evacuation, this rhetoric could still be a powerful political tool to create urgency for water conservation, build support for the long-term relocation project, or deflect blame for the crisis. This is also a plausible scenario. P(E|~H) ≈ 0.3.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** (0.9 / 0.3) = 3. This evidence significantly **increases** the probability.

*   **Evidence B: Lack of Logistical Preparations or Broader Political Support.** There is no public evidence of budget allocations, parliamentary action, or, crucially, public support for this idea from other major power centers in Iran, such as the Supreme Leader or the IRGC.
    *   **P(E | H):** If a genuine evacuation of 100,000+ people were to be announced within the next three weeks, it is almost inconceivable that massive, visible logistical preparations and clear public alignment from all key power centers would not be underway. The absence of this evidence is very strong. P(E|H) is very low, ≈ 0.05.
    *   **P(E | ~H):** If no evacuation is planned, the current situation (a president making statements without the backing of the state's full machinery) is exactly what we would expect to see. P(E|~H) is very high, ≈ 0.95.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** (0.05 / 0.95) ≈ 0.053. This evidence very strongly **decreases** the probability.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)

1.  **Start with Prior Odds:** 1:99 (1% probability).
2.  **Update with Evidence A (Rhetoric):**
    *   Posterior Odds = Prior Odds × Likelihood Ratio = (1:99) × 3 = 3:99 = 1:33.
    *   This updates the probability to 1 / (1 + 33) ≈ 3%.
3.  **Update with Evidence B (Lack of Logistics/Support):**
    *   Posterior Odds = Previous Odds × Likelihood Ratio = (1:33) × 0.053 ≈ 0.053:33, which simplifies to approximately 1:623.
    *   This brings the final probability to 1 / (1 + 623) ≈ 0.16%.

The formal update results in a very low probability. The strong signal from the President's rhetoric is completely overwhelmed by the stronger counter-signal of inaction from the rest of the Iranian state apparatus.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

*   **Alternative Scenario:** Could the government announce a "symbolic" or "phased" evacuation to make a political point, even without full logistical readiness? For example, an order to evacuate a single, hard-hit district or a specific group of non-essential government workers, with the number tailored to exceed the 100,000 threshold. This would satisfy the resolution criteria.
*   **Plausibility:** This is the most likely path to a "Yes." It would allow the President to claim he is taking decisive action while deferring the immense challenge of a full-scale evacuation. However, even this would be highly disruptive, costly, and politically risky without the backing of the Supreme Leader. It could easily create panic and chaos that the regime cannot control.
*   **Adjustment:** The purely mathematical update resulted in a probability below 1%. The "symbolic evacuation" scenario represents a plausible, if unlikely, tail risk. To account for this possibility—that the President's rhetoric is a prelude to a dramatic political act rather than just posturing—I will adjust the final probability upward from the calculated sub-1% figure. A probability in the low single digits seems appropriate to capture this risk.

### 6. Final Forecast

The base rate for such an event is nearly zero. While the President's rhetoric is a powerful and unusual signal pushing the probability up, the immense logistical, financial, and political barriers—most notably the lack of public support from Iran's ultimate decision-makers—are a far stronger counter-signal. The most probable interpretation is that the President is using the *threat* of evacuation as a political lever. However, there is a small but non-zero chance of a symbolic announcement designed for political effect. Weighing these factors, the probability remains very low.

Final: 3%
