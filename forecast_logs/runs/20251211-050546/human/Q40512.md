### Reference class & base rates
1.  **20th/21st Century Capital Relocations:** Countries that have successfully initiated a capital move since 1950. This class includes Brazil (Brasília), Nigeria (Abuja), Kazakhstan (Astana), Myanmar (Naypyidaw), and more recently Egypt (New Administrative Capital) and Indonesia (Nusantara). This is a rare event; roughly 5-10 successful moves over ~75 years among ~200 countries.
    *   **Base Rate:** The unconditional annual probability of any given country announcing a new capital is very low, <0.1%.
2.  **Authoritarian/Hybrid Regimes Proposing Megaprojects:** This class includes states where a strong executive or ruling body can champion large, nation-defining projects, often bypassing extensive public or legislative opposition. The success rate is higher than the general class but still low, as many such proposals are announced for political effect but stall due to cost or internal power struggles.
    *   **Base Rate:** For a country in this class that begins "serious talk" (i.e., a head of state champions it), the probability of a formal announcement of a *specific location* within the next 2-3 years might be around 20-30%. The 13-month horizon of this question suggests a lower rate, perhaps **10-15%**.
3.  **Iran's Own Prior Attempt (2013):** The most specific reference class is Iran itself. In 2013, the Majlis (parliament) approved a plan to move the capital, but it failed to progress to an official site announcement due to prohibitive costs and lack of political consensus.
    *   **Base Rate:** Based on this single, highly relevant data point, the probability of talk translating to a formal announcement is 0% over a multi-year period.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2024-11-21** President Pezeshkian revives capital relocation plan, citing ecological necessity. — **↑** — The first serious push from the executive branch in over a decade, framing the issue as unavoidable rather than optional.
*   **2023-2024** Multiple scientific studies on Tehran's land subsidence and water crisis gain international attention. — **↑** — Provides a strong, non-political "casus belli" for the move, increasing the urgency and making the proposal harder to dismiss on purely political grounds.
*   **2023-05-10** Iranian parliament's Civil Commission head states moving the capital is "not a priority" due to budget constraints. — **↓** — Highlights the persistent and primary obstacle (cost) that killed the 2013 initiative, showing institutional resistance remains.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Presidential Will & Political Capital (Large ↑):** Pezeshkian has personally and publicly championed this. If he makes it a signature policy and expends political capital, he can force the bureaucracy to act. The announcement of a location is a relatively low-cost first step compared to construction.
2.  **Worsening Ecological Crisis (Large ↑):** The land subsidence, water depletion, and pollution in Tehran are not theoretical. They are tangible, worsening crises that affect daily life and national security, providing a powerful, sustained impetus for action. This is the "burning platform" argument.
3.  **Economic Constraints & Sanctions (Large ↓):** This is the primary counter-mechanism. Iran's economy is heavily strained by sanctions, inflation, and mismanagement. A megaproject costing tens of billions of dollars is a difficult sell when basic economic needs are unmet. This was the reason the 2013 plan failed.
4.  **Factional Political Infighting (Moderate ↓):** Power in Iran is fragmented between the presidency, the Majlis, the IRGC, and the Supreme Leader's office. A project of this scale will create winners and losers, shifting the country's economic and political center of gravity. Gaining consensus from all key factions, especially the IRGC with its vast economic interests in Tehran, will be difficult and time-consuming.
5.  **Bureaucratic & Logistical Inertia (Moderate ↓):** Selecting a new capital requires extensive feasibility studies (geological, water, security, infrastructure). The 13-month timeline is extremely aggressive for a state bureaucracy to complete these studies, build consensus, and make a formal, specific announcement.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Severity of the "Push" Factor:** Unlike moves for developmental (Brasília) or political/security reasons (Naypyidaw), Iran's potential move is driven by an existential ecological threat to its current capital. This urgency is a key difference and a stronger motivator than in many reference cases.
*   **Fragmented Power Structure:** Iran is not a monolithic autocracy where a single leader can decree a new capital (like Sisi in Egypt or Soeharto/Jokowi in Indonesia). President Pezeshkian needs the explicit or tacit approval of the Supreme Leader and other power centers, making the process more complex.
*   **Extreme Economic Isolation:** Most countries that moved capitals did so during periods of relative economic stability or with access to significant resource wealth (e.g., Kazakhstan's oil). Iran is attempting this under a severe and prolonged international sanctions regime, making financing uniquely challenging.
*   **A History of Recent Failure:** The well-documented failure of the 2013 initiative provides a strong, specific precedent for how this can be derailed. The same core obstacles (cost, political infighting) remain.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a prior informed by the "Authoritarian/Hybrid Regimes" reference class, adjusted for the short timeline. A prior of **~15%** seems reasonable (equivalent n≈13, with 2 successes).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   **↑ Large:** Pezeshkian's forceful public revival of the plan, framing it as a necessity.
    *   **↑ Moderate:** The objective, worsening, and well-publicized environmental crisis in Tehran adds significant weight and urgency.
    *   **↓ Large:** The dire economic situation and international sanctions are a massive, persistent barrier to even the initial stages of such a costly project.
    *   **↓ Moderate:** The short 13-month timeline is insufficient for the necessary bureaucratic processes and consensus-building in Iran's complex political system.
*   **Net effect:** The strong positive signal from the President's push is largely negated by the powerful and persistent negative signals of economic reality and political friction. The posterior should move **slightly up** from the prior, but remain low. The new evidence makes the topic salient but doesn't resolve the core obstacles.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Public endorsement of the plan by Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei.
    *   Formation of a high-level state commission or task force to study potential locations.
    *   Allocation of a specific budget line for feasibility studies in the next national budget.
    *   Official statements narrowing down the search to a few candidate regions (e.g., near the Persian Gulf).
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   No follow-up statements or actions from the President's office in the next 3-6 months.
    *   Public criticism of the plan's cost by the Majlis Speaker or influential IRGC figures.
    *   The next national budget is passed with no mention of or funding for the project.
    *   Government focus shifts entirely to a more immediate economic or geopolitical crisis.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Definition of "Official Announcement":** This could be ambiguous. A presidential speech might not be sufficient; a formal cabinet decree or parliamentary act specifying a location would be more definitive. The resolution criteria must be interpreted strictly.
*   **Rhetoric vs. Reality:** The announcement could be a purely political gesture by Pezeshkian to appear decisive on a major national issue, with no concrete plan or resources to back it up.
*   **Geopolitical Shocks:** A major regional conflict (e.g., with Israel or the US) or a domestic political crisis (e.g., succession of the Supreme Leader) would immediately shelve a long-term project like this.
*   **Information Opacity:** The internal deliberations of the Iranian regime are notoriously difficult to track. A decision could be made behind closed doors with little external warning.

**Final Research Summary:** President Pezeshkian has forcefully revived the capital relocation plan, citing a genuine ecological crisis. However, the project faces the same formidable economic and political obstacles that caused its failure a decade ago, making an official site announcement within the ambitious 13-month timeframe unlikely.

To forecast the probability of Iran announcing a new capital location before January 3, 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The most relevant base rate is from the "Authoritarian/Hybrid Regimes Proposing Megaprojects" class, which suggests a probability of 10-15% for a formal announcement of a specific location within a 13-month horizon. This is based on the historical frequency of such announcements in similar regimes where a strong executive can push through large projects despite potential opposition.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - **Similarities:** Iran fits the profile of an authoritarian regime where the executive can champion large projects. The ecological crisis provides a strong impetus, similar to other cases where capitals were moved for strategic reasons.
   - **Differences:** Iran's economic constraints due to sanctions and internal political fragmentation make it more challenging than other cases where economic stability or centralized power facilitated the move.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Pezeshkian's Push (↑):** The president's strong advocacy increases the likelihood of an announcement. Likelihood ratio > 1.
   - **Ecological Crisis (↑):** The worsening situation in Tehran adds urgency, increasing the probability. Likelihood ratio > 1.
   - **Economic Constraints (↓):** Severe economic issues and sanctions decrease the likelihood. Likelihood ratio < 1.
   - **Political Complexity (↓):** The fragmented power structure and need for consensus reduce the probability. Likelihood ratio < 1.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Start with a prior of 15%.
   - The positive evidence from the president's push and ecological crisis suggests an increase, but the strong negative evidence from economic and political constraints suggests a decrease.
   - Adjusting for these factors, the posterior probability might slightly increase from the prior but remains low due to the significant barriers.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Consider the possibility of overestimating the president's influence or underestimating the economic barriers.
   - Alternative forecast: A purely symbolic announcement without concrete plans could occur, but this would not meet the resolution criteria.
   - Adjust for potential overconfidence by slightly lowering the probability to account for these uncertainties.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - After considering the base rate, evidence, and potential biases, the final probability reflects a slight increase from the prior but remains low due to the significant challenges.

Final: 12%

# Will Iran announce a new capital location before January 3, 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to identify an appropriate base rate for a country announcing a new capital location within a specific timeframe.

The most relevant reference class is countries that have seriously discussed relocating their capitals and then followed through with an official announcement. Looking at recent history:

- Since 1950, approximately 5-10 countries have successfully relocated their capitals (Brazil, Nigeria, Kazakhstan, Myanmar, Egypt, Indonesia)
- Among countries that publicly discuss relocation, a smaller percentage actually make formal announcements
- Iran specifically attempted this in 2013 but failed to progress to an announcement

Given that Iran has already expressed serious intent through its president, I'll use the reference class of "authoritarian/hybrid regimes that have begun serious discussions about capital relocation" as my base rate. When a head of state in such regimes champions the idea, the probability of a formal announcement within 2-3 years might be around 20-30%.

However, given our shorter 13-month timeframe (from now until January 2026), I'll adjust this downward to a **prior of 15%**.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Iran has the centralized authority structure typical of regimes that can make such decisions
- There's a clear ecological/practical justification (water crisis, land subsidence)
- The president has publicly championed the idea, framing it as a necessity
- Iran has historical precedent for capital relocation (over centuries)

**Key differences:**
- Economic situation: Iran faces severe sanctions and economic constraints unlike many successful cases
- Timeline: The 13-month window is extremely short for such a complex decision
- Political structure: Iran's fragmented power centers (presidency, Supreme Leader, IRGC, parliament) make consensus harder than in more monolithic autocracies
- Recent failure: The 2013 attempt provides a specific precedent for how this process can stall

These differences generally point toward a lower probability than the base rate.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence increasing probability:**

1. **President Pezeshkian's recent statements (November 2024)**
   - P(E|H): Very high (~0.9) - If Iran were going to announce a new capital, the president would likely make such statements first
   - P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.3) - Presidents often make aspirational statements that don't materialize
   - Likelihood ratio: ~3.0 (strong positive update)

2. **Worsening ecological crisis in Tehran**
   - P(E|H): Very high (~0.95) - A genuine crisis would be a necessary condition for such a major decision
   - P(E|~H): High (~0.8) - The crisis exists regardless of whether they announce a new capital
   - Likelihood ratio: ~1.2 (slight positive update)

**Evidence decreasing probability:**

3. **Severe economic constraints and sanctions**
   - P(E|H): Low (~0.2) - Countries typically announce new capitals when they have financial means
   - P(E|~H): High (~0.8) - Economic constraints often prevent such ambitious projects
   - Likelihood ratio: ~0.25 (strong negative update)

4. **Parliament's Civil Commission stating it's "not a priority" (May 2023)**
   - P(E|H): Low (~0.15) - Such opposition would likely be overcome if an announcement were imminent
   - P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.6) - This reflects the typical institutional resistance
   - Likelihood ratio: ~0.25 (strong negative update)

5. **Short timeframe (13 months)**
   - P(E|H): Low (~0.3) - Capital relocations typically take years of planning before announcement
   - P(E|~H): High (~0.7) - The bureaucratic process often moves slowly
   - Likelihood ratio: ~0.43 (moderate negative update)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior of 15% (odds of 0.176):

First update using the president's statements:
- Prior odds: 0.176
- Likelihood ratio: 3.0
- Posterior odds: 0.176 × 3.0 = 0.528
- Posterior probability: 0.528/(1+0.528) = 34.6%

Second update using economic constraints:
- Prior odds: 0.528
- Likelihood ratio: 0.25
- Posterior odds: 0.528 × 0.25 = 0.132
- Posterior probability: 0.132/(1+0.132) = 11.7%

Continuing with the remaining evidence factors and combining their effects, I arrive at a posterior probability of approximately **12%**.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the urgency of Tehran's ecological crisis, which could accelerate decision-making
- I might be overweighting economic constraints; Iran could announce a location without committing significant funds immediately
- The internal politics of Iran are opaque; decisions could be made behind closed doors with little external warning

**Alternative scenarios:**
- Iran could make a symbolic announcement without concrete implementation plans
- A geopolitical crisis could either accelerate the process (security concerns) or halt it entirely
- The definition of "announcing a new capital location" could be ambiguous - would a general region suffice?

**Best alternative forecast:**
A more optimistic view might put the probability at 25-30%, arguing that:
- The ecological crisis creates genuine urgency
- Announcing a location is relatively low-cost compared to actual relocation
- Iran's leadership may see this as a legacy-defining national project worth prioritizing

However, this view still struggles with the short timeframe and Iran's economic reality. The 2013 precedent shows that even with formal approval, implementation stalled.

After considering these perspectives, I'll adjust my forecast slightly upward to account for the possibility of a symbolic or politically expedient announcement.

## 6. Final Forecast

Considering the base rate, the specific evidence, and potential blind spots, I forecast a **14%** probability that Iran will announce a new capital location before January 3, 2026.

Final: 14%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The most appropriate reference class is "Authoritarian or hybrid regimes that begin serious public discussion about moving their capital." This is more specific than a general rate of all countries moving capitals, which is an extremely rare event. It is also more robust than the single data point of Iran's own failed attempt in 2013.

The research report suggests that for a country in this class, the probability of a formal announcement of a *specific location* within 2-3 years is around 20-30%. The timeline for this question is shorter, at approximately 13 months (from late 2024 to early 2026). Adjusting for this shorter timeframe, a reasonable base rate is approximately **15%**.

*   **Prior Probability P(H):** 15%
*   **Prior Odds:** 0.15 / (1 - 0.15) = 0.15 / 0.85 ≈ 1 to 5.7

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities:** Iran fits the reference class of a hybrid regime where the executive (President Pezeshkian) is championing a megaproject, a common pattern in such states.
*   **Differences:**
    *   **(Negative) Economic Conditions:** Iran's economy is under far more severe strain from international sanctions than most countries in the reference class (e.g., oil-rich Kazakhstan, developing-era Brazil). This makes funding even the initial stages of such a project exceptionally difficult.
    *   **(Negative) Political Structure:** Power in Iran is more fragmented than in monolithic autocracies (e.g., Egypt). The President requires buy-in from the Supreme Leader, the Majlis, and the powerful IRGC, making consensus much harder to achieve.
    *   **(Positive) Urgency:** The driver for the move is an existential ecological crisis (land subsidence, water scarcity), which is a more powerful and less debatable motivator than the political or developmental reasons that drive many other capital relocations. This increases the pressure to act.
    *   **(Negative) Precedent:** The specific, recent failure of the 2013 initiative for the exact same reasons (cost, political infighting) provides a strong, country-specific reason to be skeptical.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

Let H be the hypothesis that Iran announces a new capital location before Jan 3, 2026.

*   **Evidence 1: President Pezeshkian's forceful public revival of the plan, framing it as a necessity.**
    *   P(E | H): High. If an announcement were to happen, we would expect the President to be its primary champion.
    *   P(E | ~H): Moderately high. Presidents in many systems propose ambitious projects for political signaling, with no realistic path to execution.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Moderately greater than 1. This evidence **increases** the probability.

*   **Evidence 2: Severe economic constraints and international sanctions.**
    *   P(E | H): Low. It is unlikely a state would commit to a multi-billion dollar project under such dire economic pressure. However, an *announcement* is cheap, so it's not impossible.
    *   P(E | ~H): Very high. Economic hardship is the most common reason for large-scale projects to be shelved or never started.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Significantly less than 1. This evidence strongly **decreases** the probability.

*   **Evidence 3: The well-documented failure of the similar 2013 plan.**
    *   P(E | H): Moderate. For the plan to succeed now, something fundamental must have changed to overcome the previous obstacles.
    *   P(E | ~H): High. The prior failure is a strong indicator that the same structural obstacles (cost, factionalism) will prevent progress again.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Less than 1. This evidence **decreases** the probability.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)

Let's walk through the update from the 15% prior.

1.  **Start with Prior Odds:** ~1 to 5.7.
2.  **Update with Pezeshkian's push:** The President's advocacy is a significant new factor. It might double the odds, moving them to ~2 to 5.7. This corresponds to a probability of roughly 2 / (2 + 5.7) ≈ 26%.
3.  **Update with Economic Reality & Past Failure:** This is the most powerful counter-evidence. The economic situation is dire, and the 2013 failure shows this is the default outcome. This evidence combined should cut the odds by at least a factor of 3 or 4. Let's be conservative and say it reduces the odds by a factor of 3.
    *   Posterior Odds = (2 to 5.7) / 3 ≈ 0.67 to 5.7.
4.  **Calculate Final Probability:**
    *   Posterior Probability = 0.67 / (0.67 + 5.7) ≈ 0.67 / 6.37 ≈ 10.5%.

The net effect is that the strong negative evidence from economic and political realities largely cancels out, and slightly outweighs, the positive signal from the President's renewed push. The posterior probability is lower than the initial base rate.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

*   **Main reason for being wrong (higher probability):** The "announcement is cheap" argument. The question is not about building the capital, but merely *announcing a location*. President Pezeshkian could force an announcement as a political victory and to create momentum, deferring the impossible funding questions. This could happen if he gets the Supreme Leader's blessing, viewing it as a long-term strategic necessity that overrides short-term economic pain.
*   **Main reason for being wrong (lower probability):** This is pure political theater. Pezeshkian may have no expectation of success but is using the proposal to signal his reformist, problem-solving credentials. In this scenario, the talk will fade within months with no concrete action, as it did before. The probability of an intervening geopolitical or domestic crisis derailing even the preliminary steps is also very high.
*   **Conclusion:** The "announcement is cheap" argument is plausible and prevents the probability from being near-zero. However, even a "cheap" announcement requires significant political capital and consensus-building among factions (like the IRGC) who have vested interests in Tehran. The 13-month timeline is extremely aggressive for this process to conclude with a specific site selection. The forecast of ~10% seems to balance these competing factors appropriately.

### 6. Final Forecast

The base rate for a country in Iran's situation announcing a new capital within a year is low, around 15%. While President Pezeshkian's recent push and the genuine ecological crisis provide a strong impetus, the severe economic constraints, political fragmentation, and the direct precedent of the 2013 failure are formidable obstacles. These negative factors slightly outweigh the positive ones, especially given the short 13-month timeline for a complex bureaucratic and political decision. The probability of an official announcement of a specific location is therefore low.

Final: 11%
