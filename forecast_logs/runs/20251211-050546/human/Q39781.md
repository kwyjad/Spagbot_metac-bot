### Reference class & base rates
1.  **States of Emergency under the Noboa Administration (Nov 2023 - Present):** President Noboa has frequently used states of emergency (SoEs) to address security and social crises. In his first ~25 months in office (based on the fictional timeline), he has declared at least two major SoEs: a nationwide (24 provinces) SoE in January 2024 for gang violence and a 16-province SoE in October 2025 for protests. This suggests a high propensity to use this tool. A rough base rate is that some part of the country is under an SoE for approximately 4-5 months per year, or ~35-40% of the time. The number of provinces involved has ranged from 16 to 24.
2.  **Short-term, Crisis-Driven SoEs in Ecuador (2019-2025):** Historically, SoEs in Ecuador are reactive measures to acute events (e.g., major protests in 2019 and 2022, prison riots, security crises). They are typically declared for 60 days, as per constitutional limits, with a possible 30-day extension. They are not permanent fixtures. The base rate for an SoE being active on any random day is moderate, but the probability of a *new* one being declared in a specific two-week window is low, absent a major triggering event.
3.  **Localized vs. National SoEs:** SoEs can be national (24 provinces) or targeted. Those for widespread social unrest (Oct 2025) or systemic security breakdowns (Jan 2024) tend to be broad. Those for localized crime waves are often restricted to a few specific provinces (e.g., Guayas, Manabí, Esmeraldas, and now potentially El Oro). This suggests the outcome is likely to be 0, 1-3, or a much larger number (15+), with outcomes in the 4-14 range being less common.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **[2025-12-10]** President Noboa deploys over 2,000 soldiers to El Oro province to combat extreme criminal violence. — **↑** — A massive military mobilization is often a direct precursor to a formal state of emergency declaration, signaling the situation has overwhelmed civilian control.
*   **[~2025-12-05]** (Implied) The 60-day state of emergency in 16 provinces, declared on Oct 4-6, expires. — **↓** — The legal basis for the previous SoE has ended. The default status of all provinces is now "not in a state of emergency," resetting the count to zero.
*   **[2025-10-04/06]** SoE declared in 16 provinces due to protests over fuel subsidy cuts. — **↑** — Establishes a recent precedent for large-scale SoEs in response to social unrest. The underlying cause (subsidy cuts) is likely unresolved, creating latent risk.
*   **[2025-04-24]** Foiled assassination attempt against President Noboa in El Oro province. — **↑** — Dramatically increases the political and security stakes in El Oro, making the government highly sensitive and likely to use exceptional measures there.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Escalation of Organized Crime:** This is the primary driver. Targeted assassinations of officials (mayor of Arenillas), bombings, and direct threats against the President (as seen in El Oro) can force the government's hand to declare an SoE to enable military action. (Impact: Large)
2.  **President Noboa's Political Strategy:** Noboa has built his political brand on a tough-on-crime, "iron fist" approach. Declaring an SoE, especially in a high-profile crisis zone like El Oro, reinforces this image and demonstrates control. His personal leadership of security blocks indicates high engagement. (Impact: Moderate)
3.  **Constitutional Time Limits:** SoEs are legally capped at 60 days, renewable once for 30 days. The expiration of the October SoE demonstrates this mechanism. It acts as a constraint, forcing a periodic reset to zero unless a new crisis justifies a new declaration. (Impact: Moderate)
4.  **Social Unrest & Protests:** The unresolved issue of fuel subsidies remains a potential trigger. While quiet now, a flare-up during the holiday season could prompt a new SoE, though this seems less immediate than the crime issue in El Oro. (Impact: Small, in the short term)
5.  **A "Focusing Event":** The short 14-day horizon makes the forecast highly sensitive to a single, dramatic event. A major prison riot, a new political assassination, or a large-scale terrorist-style attack would almost certainly trigger an immediate SoE, likely localized to the event's province(s). (Impact: Large)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **"Internal Armed Conflict" Doctrine:** The declaration of a national "internal armed conflict" in January 2024 provides a standing legal and political framework that lowers the threshold for military intervention and SoE declarations compared to previous administrations.
*   **Intense Focus on a Single Province (El Oro):** The confluence of a mayor's assassination, a foiled plot against the President, and a massive military deployment creates an exceptionally volatile and high-stakes situation concentrated in one specific province. This is more acute than a general, nationwide crime problem.
*   **Proximity to Resolution Date:** The key events (expiration of the old SoE, military deployment in El Oro) are happening immediately before the forecast window, making the situation highly dynamic and less reliant on long-term base rates.
*   **Noboa's High Propensity:** Compared to a generic reference class of Ecuadorian presidencies, Noboa's administration has shown a significantly higher willingness to declare SoEs as a primary policy tool.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a prior centered heavily on 0, reflecting the recent expiration of the last SoE. For instance, P(0) = 0.80, P(1-3) = 0.15, P(>3) = 0.05. This reflects a belief that SoEs are exceptional, not constant. Use a low equivalent n (e.g., n=10) due to the volatile environment.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   **↓ (Large):** The 16-province SoE expired ~Dec 5. This is a powerful update toward 0, as it is the current state of affairs.
    *   **↑ (Large):** The massive military deployment to El Oro on Dec 10 is a clear and immediate signal that an SoE is being considered or is the next logical step for that specific province. This dramatically increases the probability of the outcome being exactly 1.
    *   **↑ (Moderate):** The history of severe, high-profile violence in El Oro (foiled plot, mayor's murder) provides strong justification for an SoE, making a declaration politically easy for the government.
    *   **↑ (Small):** The unresolved fuel subsidy issue and Noboa's general propensity to use SoEs slightly increase the background risk of a wider declaration, but this is secondary to the El Oro situation.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly pulls the forecast away from 0. The expiration is "old news" compared to the Dec 10 deployment. The posterior should shift significantly, with the modal outcome likely becoming 1 (El Oro). The probability of 0 should decrease substantially, and the probability of 1 should increase to become the most likely outcome.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Any new high-profile violent incident (e.g., bombing, assassination) in El Oro or neighboring provinces.
    *   Official presidential decree (`decreto ejecutivo`) formally declaring a state of emergency.
    *   Statements from military command in El Oro that the situation requires additional legal powers.
    *   Renewed large-scale protests by indigenous groups like CONAIE.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Government announcements of major arrests or operational successes in El Oro, suggesting the situation is under control without an SoE.
    *   A period of relative calm with no major security incidents through the Christmas holiday.
    *   President Noboa traveling outside of El Oro and focusing on other non-security issues.

To forecast the number of provinces in Ecuador that will be in a state of emergency on December 25, 2025, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate is derived from the historical use of states of emergency (SoEs) under President Noboa, who has shown a high propensity to declare SoEs. Historically, SoEs have been declared in 16 to 24 provinces, with some part of the country under an SoE for approximately 35-40% of the time. The base rate for a random day having an SoE is moderate, but the probability of a new one being declared is low without a major event.
   - Mean/median: 0 provinces (default state post-expiration), with a variance reflecting the potential for rapid change due to crises.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarity: The recent expiration of the 16-province SoE aligns with the base case where no provinces are under an SoE.
   - Difference: The deployment of 2,000 soldiers to El Oro and the high-profile violence there suggest a heightened risk of a new SoE, particularly localized to El Oro.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - The expiration of the 16-province SoE (↓ likelihood of >0 provinces).
   - Military deployment to El Oro and past violence (↑ likelihood of 1 province, El Oro).
   - Noboa's political strategy and unresolved issues (↑ likelihood of broader SoE, but less immediate).

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - Prior: P(0) = 0.80, P(1-3) = 0.15, P(>3) = 0.05.
   - Evidence: The military deployment and high-profile incidents in El Oro strongly suggest an SoE is likely there, shifting the probability towards 1 province.
   - Posterior: Increase P(1) significantly, decrease P(0), and maintain low probabilities for >1 unless new evidence arises.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Consider the possibility of overestimating the impact of military deployment without a formal SoE declaration.
   - Alternative scenario: The situation stabilizes without an SoE, or a new crisis emerges elsewhere.
   - Adjust for potential overconfidence by slightly increasing the probability of 0 provinces.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Based on the analysis, the most likely outcome is 1 province (El Oro) under an SoE, with some probability of 0 if the situation stabilizes.

P10: 0
P20: 0
P40: 1
P60: 1
P80: 1
P90: 1

# Forecasting: How many provinces in Ecuador will be in a state of emergency on December 25, 2025?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For my prior, I'll use the pattern of states of emergency (SoEs) in Ecuador under President Noboa's administration:

- Noboa has shown a high propensity to declare SoEs (nationwide in January 2024, 16 provinces in October 2025)
- SoEs typically last 60 days (constitutional limit), with possible 30-day extensions
- The October 2025 SoE in 16 provinces would have expired around December 5, 2025
- SoEs are typically reactive to specific crises (violence, protests, etc.)

My base rate distribution:
- Mean/median: 0-1 provinces (most likely 0)
- Variance: High, with possibility of 0, 1-3, or 15+ provinces
- Prior probability mass: ~70% on 0, ~20% on 1-3, ~10% on larger numbers

This prior reflects that in the absence of an active crisis, Ecuador would have 0 provinces under SoE, but Noboa has demonstrated willingness to quickly declare them.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate:**
- Constitutional constraints on SoE duration remain (60+30 days maximum)
- Noboa is still president with his established "iron fist" approach
- The pattern of declaring SoEs in response to security threats continues

**Differences from base rate:**
- The recent military deployment to El Oro (Dec 10, 2025) represents an escalation that often precedes formal SoE declarations
- The assassination of the Arenillas mayor and foiled plot against Noboa in El Oro create an acute, province-specific crisis
- The previous 16-province SoE has just expired (around Dec 5), creating a "reset" in the count
- The Christmas holiday period may affect government decision-making

These differences suggest a shift toward a higher probability of at least El Oro being under SoE, but lower probability of a nationwide declaration.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence pushing forecast up:**
- **Military deployment to El Oro (Dec 10)**: Very strong evidence (LR ~5:1) favoring at least 1 province under SoE. Military deployments of this scale typically precede or accompany formal SoE declarations.
- **Assassination of Arenillas mayor**: Strong evidence (LR ~3:1) for El Oro specifically being under SoE, as this represents the kind of high-profile violence that triggers emergency measures.
- **Foiled assassination attempt against Noboa in El Oro**: Strong evidence (LR ~3:1) for El Oro specifically, as threats against the president create strong political incentives for visible action.
- **Noboa's personal leadership of security operations in El Oro**: Moderate evidence (LR ~2:1) for an SoE, as it signals high-level commitment to addressing the crisis.

**Evidence pushing forecast down:**
- **Expiration of previous 16-province SoE (Dec 5)**: Strong evidence (LR ~4:1) favoring 0 provinces, as this represents the current legal status quo.
- **Constitutional time limits**: Moderate evidence (LR ~2:1) against widespread SoEs, as they require specific new justifications.
- **Lack of reported nationwide protests**: Moderate evidence (LR ~2:1) against a large-scale SoE, as the October fuel subsidy protests appear to have subsided.

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior:
- P(0 provinces) = 0.70
- P(1-3 provinces) = 0.20
- P(>3 provinces) = 0.10

First update based on El Oro military deployment:
- Likelihood ratio: P(deployment|1-3)/P(deployment|0) ≈ 5
- P(1-3|deployment) ∝ 0.20 × 5 = 1.0
- P(0|deployment) ∝ 0.70 × 1 = 0.7
- P(>3|deployment) ∝ 0.10 × 1 = 0.1
- Normalizing: P(0) ≈ 0.39, P(1-3) ≈ 0.56, P(>3) ≈ 0.05

Second update based on expiration of previous SoE:
- Likelihood ratio: P(expiration|0)/P(expiration|>0) ≈ 2
- P(0|expiration) ∝ 0.39 × 2 = 0.78
- P(1-3|expiration) ∝ 0.56 × 1 = 0.56
- P(>3|expiration) ∝ 0.05 × 1 = 0.05
- Normalizing: P(0) ≈ 0.56, P(1-3) ≈ 0.40, P(>3) ≈ 0.04

The posterior distribution shifts toward a higher probability of 1-3 provinces (primarily El Oro) compared to my initial prior, while still maintaining significant probability on 0 provinces.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overweighting recent events in El Oro and underestimating the possibility of calm being restored quickly.
- I haven't fully accounted for the Christmas holiday timing - government might delay non-urgent declarations until after holidays.
- I may be underestimating the possibility of rapid escalation to multiple provinces if violence spreads.
- The fuel subsidy issue could reignite protests suddenly, leading to a much larger SoE.

**Alternative forecast:**
A plausible alternative would place much higher probability on 0 provinces, arguing that:
- Military deployment might be sufficient without a formal SoE
- The government may want to project normalcy during Christmas
- The constitutional reset after the previous SoE expiration creates a higher barrier

Rebuttal: The assassination of a mayor and threats against the president represent extraordinary circumstances that typically trigger formal emergency powers, not just military presence.

**Tail risks:**
- Upper tail: A major terrorist attack or coordinated crime wave could trigger a nationwide SoE (24 provinces)
- Lower tail: Even with the El Oro situation, the government might delay formal SoE declaration until after Christmas

After this consideration, I'll slightly increase my uncertainty range to account for these scenarios.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

My prior distribution is based on the recent history of states of emergency (SoEs) in Ecuador, particularly under the Noboa administration. The default state for any province is "not in a state of emergency." SoEs are exceptional, temporary measures.

*   **Reference Class:** The cycle of SoE declarations and expirations in Ecuador from 2022-2025. These are typically declared for 60 days in response to a crisis and then expire.
*   **Prior Distribution:** Given that a major 16-province SoE just expired around December 5, 2025, the natural starting point or prior is heavily skewed towards zero. Without new information, the most likely outcome for any random day shortly after an expiration is 0.
*   **Prior Shape:** I'll model this as a distribution where P(0) is high (e.g., ~60%), with a small probability of a new, localized SoE (1-3 provinces, ~20%) and a slightly smaller probability of a renewed large-scale SoE (15+ provinces, ~15%), reflecting the bimodal nature of Noboa's previous declarations. The median of this prior is 0.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

The current situation differs significantly from a generic "post-SoE" period due to an acute, localized crisis.

*   **Similarities:** The underlying drivers of instability (organized crime, social tensions over subsidies) are persistent, fitting the general pattern of recurring crises. The legal mechanism of a 60-day SoE expiring is also standard.
*   **Differences:** The situation is not a general, low-level security threat. There is an intense and specific crisis in El Oro province, marked by a mayor's assassination, a foiled assassination attempt on President Noboa himself in that province, and now a massive military deployment. This concentration of high-stakes events in one location makes it a powerful focal point for government action, unlike a more diffuse, nationwide problem.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will evaluate the key pieces of recent information to update my prior.

*   **Evidence 1 (Strongly favors 0):** The 16-province SoE expired around December 5. This is a powerful piece of evidence establishing the current baseline as 0. It confirms the "off" state of the system.
*   **Evidence 2 (Strongly favors 1+):** The deployment of over 2,000 soldiers to El Oro on December 10. This is a major operational move. Such a large deployment is highly indicative of a situation deemed beyond the capacity of civilian police. It is far more likely to occur as a precursor to or in conjunction with an SoE (which grants the military expanded powers) than without one. This evidence dramatically increases the likelihood of an outcome of at least 1 (for El Oro). The likelihood ratio of this deployment given an impending SoE vs. no impending SoE is very high.
*   **Evidence 3 (Strengthens case for 1+):** The preceding events in El Oro (foiled plot against Noboa, mayor's murder). This provides the political justification and urgency for an SoE. It makes a declaration politically easy and expected, reducing the chance that the government will opt for a less forceful response.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

*   **Conceptual Update:** Posterior ∝ Prior × Likelihood(Deployment)
*   My prior was heavily weighted on 0 (P(0) ≈ 60%). The evidence of the massive military deployment to El Oro acts as a powerful likelihood update. The odds of an SoE in El Oro versus no SoE have shifted dramatically.
*   **Step-by-step:**
    1.  Start with the prior: High chance of 0.
    2.  Observe the military deployment. Ask: "How likely is this deployment if an SoE is about to be declared vs. if it is not?" The deployment is much more likely if an SoE is imminent.
    3.  This shifts significant probability mass away from 0 and concentrates it on 1 (representing El Oro).
*   **Posterior Shape:** The mode of the distribution shifts from 0 to 1. The probability of 0 is now significantly reduced, but not eliminated (the deployment could be a substitute for an SoE, not a precursor). The probability of 1 becomes the dominant outcome. There is a small but non-trivial tail for 2-4 provinces, representing potential spillover or a slightly broader security operation.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

*   **Alternative Scenario 1: The deployment is the *entire* response.** President Noboa might believe the show of force is sufficient and may want to avoid the political optics of declaring another SoE so soon. In this case, the number of provinces on Dec 25 would be 0. This is the strongest argument for a zero outcome.
*   **Alternative Scenario 2: The crisis escalates and spreads.** The violence in El Oro could be the first sign of a broader offensive by criminal groups, prompting the government to declare an SoE in several neighboring coastal provinces (e.g., Guayas, Manabí) as a preventative measure. This would lead to an outcome of 3-5.
*   **Rebuttal and Adjustment:** The severity of the threats in El Oro, including a direct (foiled) attempt on the president's life, makes a full-fledged response including an SoE more likely than not. Noboa's political brand is built on a tough-on-crime stance. However, the possibility that the deployment is a substitute for an SoE is plausible enough to keep a significant probability mass on 0. My posterior gives a ~25% chance to this scenario. The spillover scenario informs the upper tail of my distribution. My final distribution is heavily centered on 1, but with a P10/P20 of 0 and a P90 reflecting the spillover risk.

### 6. Final Percentiles

My final distribution is centered on the most likely outcome of a single state of emergency in El Oro province. The lower percentiles account for the possibility that the military deployment is deemed sufficient without a formal declaration. The upper percentiles account for the risk of the crisis spreading to a few neighboring provinces.

P10: 0
P20: 0
P40: 1
P60: 1
P80: 1
P90: 3
