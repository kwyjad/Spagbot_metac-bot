### **Research Plan**

**1. Core Questions to Investigate:**

*   **Q1: What is the historical base rate?** What is the distribution of the release decades for all UK Christmas number ones since 1952?
*   **Q2: Have there been distinct "eras" or regime changes?** How has the nature of the Christmas number one changed over time (e.g., pre-X Factor, X Factor era, LadBaby era, post-LadBaby era)?
*   **Q3: What were the results and drivers of the most recent years (2023-2024)?** Understanding the immediate past is critical in this new regime.
*   **Q4: What are the primary mechanisms that determine the winner today?** How do streaming, physical sales, social media campaigns, and charity drives interact?
*   **Q5: Who are the likely contenders for 2025?** What do early news reports, social media chatter, and betting markets indicate?
*   **Q6: What makes the current environment (2025) different from the historical average?** How does the "streaming inertia" of classics compare to the potential for a new hit?

**2. Search Queries:**

*   `List of UK Christmas number ones by year and original release date`
*   `UK Christmas number 1 2023 winner analysis`
*   `UK Christmas number 1 2024 winner analysis`
*   `Impact of streaming on UK singles chart`
*   `UK Christmas number 1 2025 contenders`
*   `UK Christmas number 1 2025 betting odds`
*   `LadBaby Christmas song 2025`
*   `New charity single UK Christmas 2025`
*   `Social media campaign Christmas number one 2025`

**3. Synthesis of Findings:**

The data reveals distinct eras. The pre-2005 era was dominated by contemporary releases. The 2005-2017 period was a mix of X Factor winners and other contemporary songs, with the 2009 Rage Against the Machine campaign being a notable exception. The 2018-2022 era was completely dominated by a single contemporary novelty act, LadBaby. The years 2023-2024 mark a new, post-LadBaby era, where the power vacuum was filled by a perennial classic ("Last Christmas," 1984) amplified by streaming. This suggests the old base rate (overwhelmingly contemporary songs) is no longer reliable. The key mechanism has shifted from active purchasing of new hits to passive streaming of established classics, which creates a high barrier to entry for new songs unless backed by a massive, coordinated campaign. Early indicators for 2025 point to a contest between established classics rather than a breakout new hit.

**4. Drafting the Research Brief:**

The brief will be structured according to the required format, integrating the synthesized findings to provide a clear, evidence-based narrative for the statistician.

### **Research Brief for Bayesian Forecasting Panel**

**TO:** Bayesian Forecasting Statistician
**FROM:** Researcher
**DATE:** 2025-12-11
**SUBJECT:** Prior Update: Decade of Original Release for 2025 UK Christmas Number One

### Reference class & base rates
Two reference classes are relevant, reflecting a significant regime change in the market.

1.  **Full History (1952–2024, n=73):** This class covers the entire history of the Christmas #1.
    *   **2020s:** 4% (3/73)
    *   **2010s:** 14% (10/73)
    *   **2000s:** 12% (9/73)
    *   **1990s:** 12% (9/73)
    *   **1980s:** 14% (10/73)
    *   **1970s:** 11% (8/73)
    *   **1960s or earlier:** 29% (21/73)
    *   **Reasoning:** This long-term view shows a relatively even distribution across modern decades but is heavily skewed by the fact that, historically, the winner was almost always a contemporary release. This makes the base rate for "2020s" artificially low as we are only halfway through the decade. A better metric is that ~90% of songs were released in the same decade they hit #1. This class is likely a poor guide to the present.

2.  **Post-LadBaby / Streaming Dominance Era (2023–2024, n=2):** This class reflects the current market structure after the exit of the dominant novelty act and with streaming as the primary consumption method.
    *   **1980s:** 100% (2/2)
    *   **All other decades:** 0%
    *   **Reasoning:** This class is small but represents the current regime where a power vacuum allowed a streaming-powered classic to dominate. It suggests the "default" outcome is now an old song, a complete reversal of the historical pattern.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2024-12-20** Wham!'s "Last Christmas" (1984) wins for a second consecutive year. — ↑ 1980s — Confirms the 2023 result was not a fluke but the start of a new pattern in the absence of a strong contemporary challenger.
*   **2023-12-22** Wham!'s "Last Christmas" (1984) wins for the first time. — ↑ 1980s — Demonstrated that in the post-LadBaby vacuum, streaming inertia for a classic song could overcome all contemporary competition.
*   **2023-01-01** (approx.) LadBaby confirms they will not release a 2023 Christmas single. — ↓ 2020s — Removed the single most dominant force for contemporary Christmas #1s from the field, creating the power vacuum that Wham! filled.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Streaming Inertia (Large):** Perennial classics ("Last Christmas," "All I Want for Christmas Is You") are embedded in millions of personal and curated playlists. This generates a massive, passive stream count from early November, creating a high baseline that new songs struggle to overcome. This strongly favors older decades (1980s, 1990s).
2.  **Organized Campaigns (Large):** A dedicated social media or charity campaign can mobilize buyers and streamers to push a specific song, new or old (e.g., Rage Against the Machine, 2009). The absence of such a campaign for a new song in 2023/2024 was decisive.
3.  **Novelty/Charity Act (Large):** A dedicated act like LadBaby can dominate by combining novelty, a compelling charity angle, and savvy social media marketing. Their absence leaves a significant gap in the "new song" camp. This driver favors the 2020s.
4.  **Major Artist Release (Moderate):** A new Christmas song from a global superstar (e.g., Ed Sheeran, Taylor Swift, Adele) could compete, but even this is not a guarantee against streaming inertia. This favors the 2020s.
5.  **Physical Sales/Special Releases (Small-Moderate):** Limited edition vinyl or CD releases can boost a song's chart position, as seen with Wham!'s 40th-anniversary release in 2024. This is often used to support campaigns for older songs.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Dominance of Streaming:** Unlike the sales-driven eras of the past, the chart is now dominated by streaming volume. This fundamentally favors familiar, nostalgic songs over new, undiscovered ones.
*   **Power Vacuum:** The end of the *X Factor*'s chart influence and, more recently, LadBaby's five-year streak has left no reliable "hit-making machine" for a contemporary Christmas #1.
*   **Lack of a "Villain":** The Rage Against the Machine (2009) and early LadBaby campaigns were fueled by a desire to beat a predictable "manufactured" pop winner. Without a clear antagonist, it is harder to rally support for an underdog or protest candidate.
*   **Nostalgia as a Market Force:** The winning songs of 2023 and 2024 were pure nostalgia plays. This cultural trend, amplified by streaming algorithms, is a powerful feature of the current market not present in most of the historical reference class.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A prior based on the full history (1952-2022) would heavily favor the **2020s** option, as the winner is almost always a contemporary release (equivalent n ≈ 70).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   **↑ 1980s (Large):** Wham!'s 2023 victory broke the contemporary mold, proving a classic could win.
    *   **↑ 1980s (Large):** Wham!'s 2024 repeat established this as the new default state of the market, not an anomaly.
    *   **↓ 2020s (Large):** LadBaby's exit removed the only proven mechanism for a contemporary song to win in the last seven years.
    *   **↑ 1980s/1990s (Large):** The underlying mechanism of streaming inertia provides a durable advantage to a small number of well-known classics.
    *   **↓ 2020s (Moderate):** The lack of any significant buzz around a new charity single or major artist Christmas release for 2025 (as of now) suggests the vacuum persists.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence mandates a massive update away from the historical prior. The posterior probability should be heavily concentrated on the **1980s**, with the **199

To forecast the decade of the original release for the 2025 UK Christmas number one, we will apply Bayesian reasoning using the provided background and research report. 

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

**Full History (1952–2024):**  
- **2020s:** 4%  
- **2010s:** 14%  
- **2000s:** 12%  
- **1990s:** 12%  
- **1980s:** 14%  
- **1970s:** 11%  
- **1960s or earlier:** 29%  

**Post-LadBaby / Streaming Dominance Era (2023–2024):**  
- **1980s:** 100%  
- **All other decades:** 0%  

Given the recent dominance of Wham!'s "Last Christmas" from the 1980s, the base rate for the 1980s is significantly higher in the current era. The historical base rate is less relevant due to the shift in market dynamics.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

The current case is similar to the post-LadBaby era where streaming inertia favors older classics. The difference is the potential for new contenders, but no strong evidence suggests a new song will dominate in 2025.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

- **Wham!'s 2023 and 2024 Wins:** Strong evidence for the 1980s, as it shows a classic can dominate in the absence of strong contemporary contenders.
- **LadBaby's Exit:** Reduces the likelihood of a 2020s song winning, as the main driver for contemporary songs is absent.
- **Streaming Inertia:** Favors older songs, particularly from the 1980s and 1990s, due to their presence in playlists.
- **Lack of New Contenders:** No significant buzz around new releases or campaigns for 2025, reducing the likelihood of a contemporary song.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

**Prior for 1980s:** 14% (Full History)  
**Likelihood of 1980s given evidence:** High, due to recent wins and streaming inertia.  
**Posterior for 1980s:** Significantly increased from the prior, reflecting the current dominance of classics.

**Prior for 2020s:** 4% (Full History)  
**Likelihood of 2020s given evidence:** Low, due to lack of new contenders and LadBaby's exit.  
**Posterior for 2020s:** Decreased from the prior.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

Consider the possibility of a surprise new release or campaign. However, the lack of evidence for such events suggests maintaining the focus on the 1980s. The best alternative forecast might consider the 1990s if another classic gains traction.

### 6. Final Normalization

Ensure probabilities sum to 100% and reflect the evidence:

- **1980s:** Highest probability due to recent wins and streaming inertia.
- **1990s:** Moderate probability as another potential classic era.
- **2020s:** Low probability due to lack of new contenders.

### 7. Output Format

1960s or earlier: 5%  
1970s: 5%  
1980s: 60%  
1990s: 15%  
2000s: 5%  
2010s: 5%  
2020s: 5%  

These probabilities reflect the dominance of streaming-powered classics from the 1980s, with some consideration for other decades based on historical patterns and potential surprises.

# Forecasting the Decade of the 2025 UK Christmas Number One

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll establish base rates from two reference classes:

**Reference Class 1: Full History (1952-2024)**
- 1960s or earlier: 29% (21/73)
- 1970s: 11% (8/73)
- 1980s: 14% (10/73)
- 1990s: 12% (9/73)
- 2000s: 12% (9/73)
- 2010s: 14% (10/73)
- 2020s: 4% (3/73) - Note: This is artificially low as we're only halfway through the 2020s

**Reference Class 2: Post-LadBaby Era (2023-2024)**
- 1980s: 100% (2/2) - Both years were Wham!'s "Last Christmas" (1984)
- All other decades: 0%

For my prior, I'll use a weighted blend of these reference classes, but with a strong emphasis on the recent regime change. The historical pattern (90% of songs being contemporary releases) has been disrupted by streaming dynamics. I'll assign:

- 20% weight to the full historical distribution
- 80% weight to the recent pattern

This gives initial priors of:
- 1960s or earlier: ~6%
- 1970s: ~2%
- 1980s: ~83%
- 1990s: ~2%
- 2000s: ~2%
- 2010s: ~3%
- 2020s: ~2%

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- The UK Christmas chart still operates under the same basic rules
- Streaming continues to be the dominant consumption method
- There remains a power vacuum after LadBaby's exit
- Nostalgia remains a powerful market force

**Key differences:**
- We're now in the third year post-LadBaby, which could allow time for new patterns to emerge
- After two consecutive wins by the same song, there may be audience fatigue with "Last Christmas"
- The 40th anniversary of "Last Christmas" was in 2024, which gave it special momentum that won't exist in 2025
- There's more time for artists to plan campaigns specifically to challenge the "Last Christmas" dominance

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence 1: Two consecutive wins by "Last Christmas" (1984)**
- P(E|1980s): Very high (~0.9) - This directly supports the 1980s option
- P(E|~1980s): Low (~0.1) - This pattern makes other decades less likely

**Evidence 2: Streaming inertia for classic Christmas songs**
- P(E|1980s): High (~0.8) - Several 1980s Christmas classics benefit from streaming inertia
- P(E|1990s): Moderate (~0.5) - Some 1990s songs like Mariah Carey's "All I Want for Christmas Is You" have strong streaming presence
- P(E|Other decades): Low (~0.2) - Fewer streaming-friendly Christmas classics from other eras

**Evidence 3: Absence of LadBaby or similar contemporary force**
- P(E|2020s): Low (~0.2) - Makes contemporary winners less likely
- P(E|Older decades): High (~0.8) - Creates opportunity for classics to dominate

**Evidence 4: No announced major campaign for 2025 yet**
- P(E|2020s): Moderate (~0.5) - There's still time for a campaign to emerge
- P(E|Older decades): Moderate (~0.5) - Status quo favors classics

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

Let's update on the strongest evidence: the two consecutive wins by "Last Christmas" (1984).

For the 1980s option:
- Prior probability: 83%
- Likelihood ratio: 0.9/0.1 = 9
- Prior odds: 83/17 = 4.88
- Posterior odds: 4.88 × 9 = 43.92
- Posterior probability: 43.92/(1+43.92) = 97.8%

This seems too extreme, as it doesn't account for potential fatigue with "Last Christmas" or new campaigns. Let's adjust by considering the other evidence.

The streaming inertia for other classics (particularly Mariah Carey's 1994 hit) suggests the 1990s deserves more probability mass. And while no major 2020s campaign has been announced, there's still time for one to emerge.

After qualitative adjustments considering all evidence:
- 1980s: ~75% (down from 97.8% to account for potential fatigue with "Last Christmas")
- 1990s: ~15% (up from nearly 0% due to streaming strength of 1990s classics)
- 2020s: ~5% (possibility of a new campaign emerging)
- Other decades: ~5% (distributed across remaining options)

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overweighting recency bias by focusing too much on 2023-2024
- I haven't considered the possibility of a cover/remake of an older song (which would count as a new release)
- I haven't accounted for potential algorithm changes in streaming platforms
- The sample size of the post-LadBaby era is extremely small (n=2)

**Alternative scenarios:**
- A major artist (Taylor Swift, Ed Sheeran, Adele) could release a Christmas song in 2025
- A charity campaign similar to Band Aid could emerge in response to a global crisis
- A viral TikTok challenge could propel an unexpected song to the top
- Streaming services could change their algorithms to reduce the advantage of perennial classics

**Best alternative forecast:**
The strongest alternative would be to predict a 2020s win (perhaps 40%) based on the historical pattern that contemporary songs usually win. The rebuttal is that the streaming era has fundamentally changed the dynamics, as evidenced by the 2023-2024 results.

After considering these factors, I'll adjust my forecast:
- 1980s: ~65% (reduced to account for potential fatigue with "Last Christmas")
- 1990s: ~15% (maintained due to streaming strength of 1990s classics)
- 2020s: ~10% (increased to account for possibility of new campaigns)
- 2010s: ~5% (some popular Christmas songs from this decade gaining streaming traction)
- 2000s: ~2%
- 1970s: ~2%
- 1960s or earlier: ~1%

## 6. Final Normalization

Ensuring the probabilities sum to 100%:

1960s or earlier: 1%
1970s: 2%
1980s: 65%
1990s: 15%
2000s: 2%
2010s: 5%
2020s: 10%

## 7. Final Forecast

1960s or earlier: 1%
1970s: 2%
1980s: 65%
1990s: 15%
2000s: 2%
2010s: 5%
2020s: 10%
(sum 100%)

```md

Here is my probabilistic forecast following the specified steps.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

Two reference classes are relevant, but one is far more informative than the other due to a recent regime change.

*   **Historical Base Rate (1952-2022):** In this period, the Christmas number one was almost always a contemporary song, often released in the same year or the year before. Using this base rate would suggest a >90% probability for the 2020s decade. However, this is a poor prior because the market structure has fundamentally changed due to the dominance of streaming and the end of the powerful "hit-making" eras of *The X Factor* and LadBaby.
*   **Current Regime Base Rate (2023-2024):** This is a very small but highly relevant reference class. In the two years since the last LadBaby song, the winner has been Wham!'s "Last Christmas," originally released in 1984. This suggests a new "default" state where streaming inertia propels a well-known classic to the top in the absence of a coordinated campaign for a new song.

My initial prior will be heavily anchored to this new regime, treating an older song as the default, but I will blend in the possibility of a return to the historical norm (a contemporary song winning). I'll start with a prior heavily favoring the 1980s, but with significant uncertainty.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities:** The 2025 case is very similar to 2023 and 2024. The market is still dominated by streaming. There is no *X Factor* to produce a guaranteed contender. LadBaby is not expected to return. This creates the same power vacuum that allowed "Last Christmas" to win twice.
*   **Differences:** The key difference is that the status quo can be challenged. After two consecutive wins for the same song, there may be audience fatigue or a "backlash" campaign favouring an alternative. A new novelty act could emerge to fill the LadBaby niche, or a major global artist could release a strong new Christmas song. The conditions are ripe for the incumbent to win again, but also for a challenger to emerge.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

*   **Evidence 1: Wham!'s "Last Christmas" (1984) won in 2023 and 2024.**
    *   This is extremely strong evidence. The likelihood of this happening if the 1980s were the new "default" decade is very high (P(E | H_1980s)). The likelihood of this happening if another decade were the default is extremely low (P(E | ~H_1980s)). This evidence massively shifts probability toward the 1980s. The second win in 2024 confirms the 2023 result was not a fluke but a feature of the new market.

*   **Evidence 2: The exit of LadBaby (dominant 2018-2022).**
    *   LadBaby was the only mechanism producing contemporary (2010s/2020s) winners in the late streaming era. Their absence is strong evidence against a 2020s winner. The likelihood of a classic song winning is much higher given LadBaby's absence (P(E | H_old_song)) than it would be if they were still active (P(E | ~H_old_song)). This shifts probability away from the 2020s.

*   **Evidence 3: Streaming Inertia as the dominant mechanism.**
    *   Perennial classics like "Last Christmas" (1984) and Mariah Carey's "All I Want for Christmas Is You" (1994) are embedded in millions of playlists, giving them a huge advantage every year. This mechanism strongly favors the 1980s and 1990s over all other decades, especially contemporary ones which start from zero streams.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

Let's start with a blended prior before the 2023 result, acknowledging the possibility of a classic winning but still respecting the long history of contemporary winners. Prior: P(1980s) = 10%, P(1990s) = 10%, P(2020s) = 50%, P(Other) = 30%.

*   **Update with 2023/2024 Wham! wins:** The prior odds for the 1980s were 0.1 / 0.9 = 0.11. The evidence (two consecutive wins for a 1984 song) is many times more likely if the 1980s song is the new default than if it isn't. Let's estimate a conservative Likelihood Ratio of 20.
*   **Posterior Odds (1980s):** 0.11 * 20 = 2.2.
*   **Posterior Probability (1980s):** 2.2 / (1 + 2.2) ≈ 69%.

This rough calculation shows how dramatically the evidence shifts the probability. The evidence similarly boosts the 1990s (as another decade of classics) and suppresses the 2020s. My final distribution will be centered around this updated view.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My primary risk is overconfidence in the 1980s based on a two-year trend. I need to consider plausible failure modes for this forecast:

1.  **The Mariah Carey Scenario:** The biggest challenger to Wham! is Mariah Carey's "All I Want for Christmas Is You" (1994). It is the other streaming behemoth. A small shift in momentum, a special release, or a fan campaign could easily see it take the top spot. This is the strongest alternative, making the 1990s a major contender.
2.  **The "New LadBaby" Scenario:** The success of LadBaby provides a blueprint for a contemporary song to win via a novelty/charity campaign. Someone could successfully copy this model in 2025. This makes a 2020s win more plausible than a simple analysis of streaming inertia would suggest.
3.  **The "Backlash" Scenario:** After two years of Wham!, the public and media might actively push for *anything else*. This could benefit Mariah Carey (1990s), another classic like Slade (1970s), or a new protest candidate (e.g., a 1990s rock song).

These considerations mean I must allocate significant probability mass away from the 1980s to the 1990s and 2020s, and a smaller amount to other decades with classic songs.

### 6. Final Normalization

I will set the 1980s as the most likely outcome, reflecting the powerful incumbency of "Last Christmas." The 1990s will be the second most likely, primarily due to Mariah Carey. The 2020s is the third most likely, representing the chance of a new hit or novelty campaign breaking through. The remaining probability is distributed among other decades with well-known Christmas songs.

*   **1980s:** 54% (Strong favorite, but far from certain)
*   **1990s:** 25% (The main challenger decade)
*   **2020s:** 15% (A return to a contemporary winner is a significant possibility)
*   **1970s:** 3% (Outside chance for classics like Slade or Wizzard)
*   **1960s or earlier:** 1% (Tail risk for older classics)
*   **2000s:** 1% (Low probability)
*   **2010s:** 1% (Low probability)

The sum is 54 + 25 + 15 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 100%. The distribution reflects the current market dynamics while acknowledging the key alternative scenarios.

### Final Answer

1960s or earlier: 1%
1970s: 3%
1980s: 54%
1990s: 25%
2000s: 1%
2010s: 1%
2020s: 15%
