### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Unilateral US military strikes against non-state actors in a third country without explicit, public host-nation consent.** This class includes actions like drone strikes in Pakistan, Yemen, or the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. The primary goal is counter-terrorism. Over the last 20 years, such actions have occurred in a handful of countries. The base rate for a *new* country being added to this list in any given year is low, perhaps **2-5%**. This case fits partially, as the proposed targets are non-state actors.
2.  **US punitive military strikes against a sovereign state.** This class includes actions like the 1986 bombing of Libya or the 2017-2018 strikes on Syria. These are typically in response to a specific transgression (e.g., state-sponsored terrorism, chemical weapons use) by an adversarial or semi-adversarial state. This is a rare event class. The base rate of the US conducting such a strike against any given country in a year is very low, **<1%**. This case fits the threatening rhetoric but not the target nation's status, as Nigeria is a security partner.
3.  **Major US military interventions initiated by presidential rhetoric.** This class considers instances where a president's strong, public threats were followed by military action (e.g., George H.W. Bush's "line in the sand" before the Gulf War). However, it also includes many instances where threats did not lead to action (e.g., various threats against North Korea or Iran). The follow-through rate on specific, short-deadline military threats is difficult to calculate but is likely well below 50%, suggesting a base rate of **10-20%** that this *specific type* of threat is realized.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   [2025-12-09] Nigerian military announces "Operation Lasting Peace," a new offensive against ISWAP in Borno state, and arrests several bandit leaders in Zamfara. ↓ — This action provides the US with a potential off-ramp, allowing the President to claim his threat prompted a positive response from Nigeria.
*   [2025-12-05] A prominent US evangelical leader praises the President's strong stance on Truth Social, and a Christian advocacy group runs cable news ads highlighting the plight of Nigerian Christians. ↑ — Increases domestic political pressure on the President to act, reinforcing the original justification for the threat and making it harder to back down without appearing weak to his base.
*   [2025-11-28] Unconfirmed reports of a bandit attack on a church in Kaduna State, Nigeria, result in dozens of casualties. ↑ — A potential triggering event that directly aligns with the President's stated casus belli, increasing the likelihood of a retaliatory or punitive response.
*   [2025-11-15] The Chairman of the African Union and the President of France issue separate statements urging restraint and diplomatic solutions. ↓ — Signals significant international political costs to unilateral US action, a factor that institutional actors within the US government (State, DoD) will emphasize.
*   [2025-11-01] President Trump orders the DoD to "prepare for possible action" and issues a direct threat of military intervention in Nigeria via public statements and Truth Social. ↑ — The initiating event. This is a highly significant move, as it sets expectations and puts presidential credibility on the line.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Presidential Volition & Credibility:** The President has personally and publicly committed to a course of action. Backing down could be perceived as weakness by his political base. This is the primary driver. (Size: Large)
2.  **A Triggering Event:** A high-profile, mass-casualty attack on a Christian community in Nigeria before the deadline could make it politically untenable for the President not to act on his threat. (Size: Large)
3.  **Institutional Friction (DoD/State Dept.):** The Pentagon and State Department will likely resist an attack on a major regional partner, citing risks of destabilizing Nigeria, alienating Africa, and jeopardizing long-term counter-terrorism goals. They will likely slow-roll planning and present the President with options that have high costs and risks. (Size: Moderate)
4.  **Nigerian Government Response:** If the Nigerian government takes credible, highly visible action against the specified groups and engages in high-level diplomacy with the US, it provides a face-saving "win" for the President to de-escalate. (Size: Moderate)
5.  **Logistical & Operational Readiness:** US Africa Command (AFRICOM) has the capability to conduct limited strikes (e.g., via drones, special operations forces, or carrier assets). The existence of prepared plans and ready assets makes an attack easier to execute if a political decision is made. (Size: Small, as it's an enabler, not a primary driver).
6.  **International Political Pressure:** Strong, unified condemnation from key allies (UK, France) and regional bodies (African Union, ECOWAS) could raise the diplomatic cost of an attack, providing additional ammunition for institutional opponents of the strike within the US government. (Size: Small)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Target is a Partner, Not an Adversary:** Unlike Libya, Syria, or non-state actors in Pakistan, Nigeria is a major security partner receiving over $1 billion in US aid. Attacking a partner nation, even if the intended targets are non-state actors within it, is exceptionally rare and carries severe diplomatic risks.
*   **Presidential Personality as Primary Driver:** The impetus for this potential action stems almost entirely from the personal style and political calculations of the current President, rather than a consensus-driven national security assessment. This makes the situation more volatile and less predictable than typical foreign policy crises.
*   **Extremely Short & Public Deadline:** The threat is tied to a very short timeframe (before 2026), creating immense pressure for a decision. This differs from the more ambiguous, long-term pressure campaigns often waged by the US.
*   **Domestic Political Justification:** The explicit framing of the intervention as protecting Christians is tailored for a specific domestic political audience, which is an unusual primary justification for US military action abroad compared to standard interests like counter-terrorism or regional stability.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a prior anchored to the reference class of attacking a major partner nation, which is extremely low (<1%). A plausible prior might be 1-2% with an equivalent n of ~100 to reflect high confidence in this structural constraint.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   President Trump's specific, public threat and DoD order: Large ↑
    *   Existence of a clear, emotionally resonant casus belli (protecting Christians) for his base: Moderate ↑
    *   Very short timeline creating "put up or shut up" pressure: Moderate ↑
    *   Strong institutional and international headwinds against attacking a partner: Large ↓
    *   Nigeria's recent announcement of a new offensive: Small ↓
    *   Recent unconfirmed attack on a church: Small ↑
*   **Net effect:** The evidence dramatically increases the probability from the extremely low prior. The powerful, personality-driven "pro-attack" factors are in direct conflict with the powerful, structural "anti-attack" factors. The posterior should move significantly upward, but the strong constraints should keep it well below 50%.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Another confirmed, large-scale attack on Christians in Nigeria.
    *   Movement of US military assets (e.g., special operations forces, naval strike group) towards the region.
    *   Evacuation advisories for US citizens or drawdown of embassy staff in Abuja.
    *   Escalation of the President's rhetoric, such as naming specific terrorist leaders as targets.
    *   Leaks from the White House about internal debates, with proponents of a strike gaining influence.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   High-level diplomatic engagement, such as the Nigerian President visiting Washington or the US Secretary of State visiting Abuja.
    *   The President publicly claiming his threats have forced the Nigerian government to act, thus declaring victory without a strike.
    *   A major new global crisis that diverts the President's attention.
    *   Public statements from senior Republican lawmakers or military leaders advising against a strike.
    *   Credible reports of successful Nigerian military operations against the groups in question.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Defining "Military Attack":** The resolution criteria are broad. A single drone strike against a bandit camp would resolve this "Yes," as would a major air campaign. The former is much more plausible than the latter.
*   **Bluster vs. Intent:** The President has a history of making dramatic threats that do not materialize. Distinguishing a negotiating tactic or a statement for domestic consumption from a genuine prelude to action is the central challenge.
*   **Information Asymmetry:** Critical information about the President's final decision-making process, the specific options presented by the DoD, and the true state of US-Nigeria back-channel talks will be unavailable.
*   **Operational Secrecy:** A limited strike, especially by special operations forces, could be conducted with minimal warning and potentially be concealed or downplayed initially.
*   **"Wag the Dog" Scenario:** A sudden domestic political crisis in the US could either divert attention (lowering the probability) or incentivize a foreign policy distraction (raising it).

**Final Research Summary:** The probability of a US military attack in Nigeria before 2026 has risen dramatically from a near-zero baseline due to a credible, public threat from a President known for unconventional action. However, the action faces immense structural, diplomatic, and institutional opposition, making a limited, symbolic strike the most likely form of attack if one occurs at all.

To forecast the probability of the United States conducting a military attack within Nigeria before 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The appropriate base rate for this event is derived from the reference class of "US punitive military strikes against a sovereign state," which is a rare event. Given Nigeria's status as a security partner, the base rate for such an action is extremely low, less than 1%. However, considering the unique circumstances and the President's rhetoric, we might start with a slightly higher prior of 1-2%.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** The situation involves potential military action against a sovereign state, aligning with the base case of punitive strikes.
- **Differences:** Nigeria is a security partner, not an adversary, making this situation atypical. The primary driver is presidential rhetoric rather than a consensus-driven national security assessment, adding volatility.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Presidential Threat and DoD Order:** The President's public threat and order to prepare for action significantly increase the likelihood of an attack. This evidence strongly increases the probability.
- **Domestic Political Pressure:** Support from evangelical leaders and advocacy groups increases pressure on the President to act, moderately increasing the probability.
- **Unconfirmed Church Attack:** Aligns with the President's stated justification, slightly increasing the probability.
- **Nigerian Military Action:** Provides a potential off-ramp for de-escalation, slightly decreasing the probability.
- **International and Institutional Resistance:** Strong opposition from international actors and within the US government significantly decreases the probability.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Starting with a prior of 1-2%, we adjust based on the evidence:
- **Prior Odds:** 1% translates to odds of 1:99.
- **Likelihood Ratio:** The combination of presidential threats and domestic pressure increases the odds, while institutional resistance decreases them. The net effect is a moderate increase in probability.

Calculating a rough posterior:
- **Posterior Odds:** Let's assume the likelihood ratio results in a 5x increase in odds due to the strong presidential push, balanced by a 3x decrease due to resistance.
- **Adjusted Odds:** (1:99) × (5/3) ≈ 5:297, translating to a probability of approximately 1.66%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** The forecast must account for the President's history of unfulfilled threats and the high diplomatic costs.
- **Alternative Scenarios:** A sudden domestic crisis could either distract or incentivize action. The possibility of a limited, symbolic strike remains plausible.
- **Adjustments:** Given the volatile nature of the situation, a slight upward adjustment is warranted to account for potential underestimation of the President's resolve.

### 6. Final Forecast
Considering all factors, including the President's rhetoric, domestic political pressure, and significant institutional resistance, the probability of a US military attack in Nigeria before 2026 is estimated at:

Final: 5%

# Will the United States conduct a military attack within Nigeria before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to select an appropriate reference class. The most relevant reference class is "US unilateral military strikes against non-state actors in a sovereign nation that is a security partner." This is a rare event, but not unprecedented.

Looking at historical data:
- The US has conducted military operations in partner nations like Pakistan (drone strikes against terrorist groups)
- However, these operations typically occurred with some form of tacit consent
- Nigeria is a major security partner receiving over $1 billion in US aid
- The timeframe is short (less than a month remaining in 2025)

Given these factors, I'll start with a low base rate of **3%**. This reflects the rarity of such actions against partner nations while acknowledging they do occasionally occur.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- The targets would be non-state actors (terrorist/extremist groups)
- The justification is framed around counter-terrorism and protecting civilians
- The US has military capabilities in the region through AFRICOM

**Key differences:**
- The threat is unusually public and specific, coming directly from the President
- The justification is explicitly religious (protecting Christians), which is atypical
- The timeline is extremely compressed (weeks, not months or years)
- Nigeria is not just any partner but a major regional ally in Africa
- The threat emerged suddenly rather than following a gradual escalation

These differences, particularly the President's direct and public involvement, suggest the probability should be adjusted upward from the base rate.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Presidential threat and DoD preparation order (Nov 1)**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.95) - If an attack is planned, such a threat would likely precede it
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.3) - The President has made threats that weren't followed through before
- Likelihood ratio: ~3.2
- This significantly increases the probability

**Evidence 2: Recent church attack in Kaduna State (Nov 28)**
- P(E|H): High (~0.8) - Such an attack provides a clear trigger for US action
- P(E|~H): High (~0.7) - Such attacks occur regularly in Nigeria regardless of US intentions
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.14
- This slightly increases the probability

**Evidence 3: Nigerian military's "Operation Lasting Peace" (Dec 9)**
- P(E|H): Moderate (~0.5) - Could be seen as insufficient, prompting US action
- P(E|~H): High (~0.8) - Provides a face-saving way for the US to claim victory without attacking
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.63
- This moderately decreases the probability

**Evidence 4: International pressure against action (Nov 15)**
- P(E|H): Moderate (~0.6) - International pressure often doesn't deter determined US action
- P(E|~H): High (~0.9) - Such pressure increases diplomatic costs and provides ammunition to internal opponents
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.67
- This moderately decreases the probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior probability of 3% (odds of 3:97 or about 1:32.3)

First update (Presidential threat):
- Prior odds: 1:32.3
- Likelihood ratio: 3.2
- Posterior odds: 3.2:32.3 ≈ 1:10.1
- Posterior probability: 1/(1+10.1) ≈ 9%

Second update (Church attack):
- Prior odds: 1:10.1
- Likelihood ratio: 1.14
- Posterior odds: 1.14:10.1 ≈ 1:8.9
- Posterior probability: 1/(1+8.9) ≈ 10.1%

Third update (Nigerian military operation):
- Prior odds: 1:8.9
- Likelihood ratio: 0.63
- Posterior odds: 0.63:8.9 ≈ 1:14.1
- Posterior probability: 1/(1+14.1) ≈ 6.6%

Fourth update (International pressure):
- Prior odds: 1:14.1
- Likelihood ratio: 0.67
- Posterior odds: 0.67:14.1 ≈ 1:21
- Posterior probability: 1/(1+21) ≈ 4.5%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the President's willingness to follow through on public threats
- The extremely short timeframe (less than a month) may not be adequately factored in
- I might be overestimating institutional resistance within the US government
- The definition of "military attack" includes even small-scale operations like a single drone strike

**Alternative scenarios:**
- A limited, symbolic drone strike could occur that satisfies the threat while minimizing diplomatic damage
- A covert operation might be conducted that is only acknowledged after the fact
- The President might authorize a strike but have it delayed until after January 1, 2026

**Adjustments needed:**
- The extremely short timeframe (less than 3 weeks remaining in 2025) is a significant constraint that should further reduce the probability
- The definition of "military attack" is broad, which should slightly increase the probability

## 6. Final Forecast

Considering all factors, especially the extremely short timeframe remaining in 2025 (today is December 11, 2025), I need to adjust my forecast downward. While the President's threat was serious, the Nigerian government's recent actions provide a face-saving way to claim victory without military action. The institutional resistance and international pressure further constrain the likelihood of action in this compressed timeframe.

Final: 4%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most appropriate reference class is the US conducting a unilateral military attack within the territory of a major security partner, without that partner's public consent. This is an exceedingly rare event. While the US conducts counter-terrorism strikes in many countries, these are typically in failed states, adversarial nations, or with some level of host-nation consent (even if coerced or tacit). Nigeria is a major regional power and a recipient of over $1 billion in US aid, making it a significant partner. The base rate for such an event against any given partner in a given year is extremely low. I will select a prior of **1%**. This reflects the strong structural and diplomatic norms against such an action.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
*   **Similarities:** The proposed targets are non-state actors (terrorists, bandits), which is a common target set for US overseas military operations. The justification is rooted in counter-terrorism and humanitarian concerns, which are also common rationales.
*   **Differences:** The crucial difference is Nigeria's status as a major security partner. Unlike strikes in Syria (an adversary), Yemen (a state with limited sovereignty), or Pakistan (a partner with a complex and often adversarial relationship regarding counter-terrorism), a unilateral strike in Nigeria would rupture a key strategic partnership in Africa. Furthermore, the primary driver is the President's personal political volition and public rhetoric, rather than a consensus-driven national security assessment, making the situation more volatile and personality-dependent than the base case.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will evaluate the key pieces of evidence and their effect on the initial 1% prior.

*   **Evidence 1: President Trump's direct, public threat and order to the DoD (Nov 1).**
    *   This is the single most important piece of evidence. A public threat from the President, tied to his political credibility, dramatically increases the chances of action.
    *   P(E | H): The probability of seeing such a specific threat if an attack were to happen is very high (>90%).
    *   P(E | ~H): The probability of seeing such a threat if no attack happens is also non-trivial, given this President's history of using threats as a political or diplomatic tool. However, the specificity of ordering the DoD to "prepare" makes it more serious than typical rhetoric.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Significantly greater than 1. This evidence causes a massive upward revision from the prior.

*   **Evidence 2: The Nigerian military's announcement of "Operation Lasting Peace" (Dec 9).**
    *   This provides the President with a perfect "off-ramp." He can claim his threat successfully forced the Nigerian government to act, allowing him to declare a victory without incurring the costs and risks of a military strike.
    *   P(E | H): The probability of Nigeria launching an offensive if a US attack is still imminent is moderate. It could be a last-ditch effort to avert it.
    *   P(E | ~H): The probability of Nigeria launching an offensive if no US attack is planned is high. It's a rational diplomatic move to de-escalate the crisis and appease the US.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Less than 1. This evidence significantly decreases the probability of an attack, as it creates a politically viable path for de-escalation.

*   **Evidence 3: A potential triggering event (unconfirmed church attack, Nov 28) and domestic political pressure (evangelical support, Dec 5).**
    *   These factors reinforce the original *casus belli*. A high-profile, mass-casualty event, especially one occurring closer to the deadline, could make it politically difficult for the President not to act on his threat.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Greater than 1. This evidence increases the probability, acting as a counterweight to the de-escalation path.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Let's start with the prior odds of 1:99 (1% probability).

1.  **Prior:** 1% (Odds: 1:99).
2.  **Update on Trump's Threat:** The threat is powerful evidence. A conservative likelihood ratio might be around 5 (i.e., this specific threat is 5 times more likely if an attack is planned than if it isn't).
    *   New Odds = 1:99 * 5 = 5:99 ≈ 1:20.
    *   New Probability ≈ 1 / (1+20) = 4.8%.
3.  **Update on Domestic Pressure & Triggering Event:** These factors reinforce the threat's credibility. Let's apply a combined likelihood ratio of 2.5.
    *   New Odds = 1:20 * 2.5 = 2.5:20 = 1:8.
    *   New Probability = 1 / (1+8) = 11.1%.
4.  **Update on Nigerian Offensive (Off-ramp):** This is a strong de-escalatory signal. Let's use a likelihood ratio of 0.5.
    *   New Odds = 1:8 * 0.5 = 0.5:8 = 1:16.
    *   New Probability = 1 / (1+17) ≈ 5.9%.

This formal update results in a low probability. However, it doesn't fully capture the volatility. A better model might be conditional on a future event. The primary uncertainty in the next 20 days is whether a new, major attack on Christians occurs, which would force the President's hand.

*   Let's estimate a 30% chance of a new, major triggering event in the next 20 days.
*   If a trigger occurs, the pressure to act would be immense, bypassing the off-ramp. I'll estimate the probability of a US strike in that scenario at **30%**.
*   If no trigger occurs (70% chance), the President will most likely take the politically safe off-ramp provided by the Nigerian offensive. The probability of a strike would be very low, say **5%**.

Expected Probability = P(Strike|Trigger) * P(Trigger) + P(Strike|No Trigger) * P(No Trigger)
Expected Probability = (0.30 * 0.30) + (0.05 * 0.70) = 0.09 + 0.035 = 0.125 or **12.5%**.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast of ~13% could be wrong for several reasons.
*   **It could be too low:** I might be overestimating the influence of institutional "brakes" (DoD, State Dept.) on this specific President. He may see a limited drone strike as a low-cost action that is easy to order and execute, and he may view the Nigerian offensive as insufficient. His personal desire to appear strong and follow through on a public threat could override all other factors.
*   **It could be too high:** I might be taking the rhetoric too seriously. The threat could have been pure political theater from the start, designed *specifically* to elicit a response from the Nigerian government that he could then take credit for. In this view, the off-ramp is not a fortunate development; it was the intended outcome all along, and the probability of an attack was always near zero.
*   **The definition of "attack":** A single drone strike against a bandit leader in a remote area would count. This is a low bar to clear. The logistical and political threshold for such an action is much lower than for a major campaign, making it more plausible than my analysis of institutional friction might suggest.

Considering these factors, the 12.5% calculation seems to balance the risks well. It acknowledges that the most likely path is de-escalation while keeping a non-trivial probability for an impulsive, trigger-driven event. I will round up slightly to 13% to reflect the outsized role of presidential personality.

### 6. Final Forecast
The probability is low but not negligible. The situation is a contest between a President's public threat and the immense institutional and diplomatic costs of acting on it. The Nigerian government has provided a clear off-ramp, which is the most probable path to resolution. However, the short timeframe and the potential for a new triggering event create significant volatility, making a limited, symbolic US strike a real possibility.

Final: 13%
