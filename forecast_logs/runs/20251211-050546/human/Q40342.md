### Reference class & base rates
1.  **MP Departures (Resignation/Floor Crossing) per Parliament:** In a typical four-year Canadian parliament (338 MPs), there are roughly 10-15 departures. This yields a base rate of approximately one departure every 3-4 months. For a ~1.5-month window, this suggests a raw probability of **25-35%**. *Limitation: This is a crude, unconditional rate that ignores the specific political context.*
2.  **Departures in the First Year of a Minority Parliament:** Minority governments are inherently less stable, leading to more political maneuvering. The period immediately following an election is often volatile as parties adjust. The rate of departures in this context is likely higher than the parliamentary average. A plausible estimate might be **35-45%** for a departure within a ~6-week window during this sensitive period. *Limitation: Each minority government situation is unique; this class is small and heterogeneous.*
3.  **Clustered Departures:** Political departures often occur in clusters, where one event lowers the barrier for subsequent ones. Given two departures just occurred in early November, the most relevant reference class is the probability of a *third* departure within 6-8 weeks of the first two. Historically, such clusters are rare but powerful when they happen (e.g., the fragmentation of the Progressive Conservative party in the early 1990s). This suggests a conditional base rate significantly higher than the general rate, perhaps in the **50-60%** range. *Limitation: The sample size for such clusters is extremely small.*

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-11-09** Split public reaction to the Liberal budget is reported. (↑) — A contentious budget creates pressure points and provides the government with specific policy items to use as bargaining chips for potential defectors.
*   **2025-11-06** Conservative MP Matt Jeneroux resigns after reported pressure from the party. (↑) — This signals that internal tensions are at a breaking point and that the Conservative party is using hardball tactics, which could backfire and push wavering MPs out.
*   **2025-11-05** Conservative MP Chris d'Entremont crosses the floor to the Liberals. (↑) — This event serves as a "proof of concept," demonstrating that defection is a viable path and potentially emboldening other dissatisfied Conservative MPs.
*   **2025-10-22** Reports emerge of Conservative MPs doubting Poilievre's leadership. (↑) — This establishes a pre-existing condition of significant internal dissent within the Conservative caucus, providing the foundational motive for further departures.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Liberal Government's Quest for a Majority (Large ↑):** The prize of a stable majority government is enormous. The Liberals are only two seats away, creating a powerful incentive to offer significant inducements (e.g., cabinet positions, committee chairships, policy commitments, future appointments) to potential defectors.
2.  **Conservative Internal Dissent (Moderate-to-Large ↑):** The provided sources indicate a clear ideological rift between Pierre Poilievre's leadership and a more moderate wing of the Conservative party. This creates a strong "push" factor for MPs who feel politically homeless.
3.  **Momentum and Social Proof (Moderate ↑):** The d'Entremont and Jeneroux departures create a "permission structure" for others. The topic is now openly discussed, and potential movers know they would not be the first, reducing the psychological barrier.
4.  **Conservative Party Discipline (Moderate ↓):** The reported "consequences" faced by Jeneroux show the Conservative party will actively try to prevent further departures through threats and pressure. This is a significant deterrent for MPs weighing their political futures and fearing ostracization or retribution.
5.  **The Budget Vote as a Catalyst (Moderate ↑):** Key votes, especially on confidence matters like a budget, force MPs to make a stand. A wavering MP could use the budget vote as a pretext to leave the party over a stated policy disagreement.
6.  **Personal Calculation and Timing (Small ↓):** The resolution window ends on Dec 31. MPs may prefer to wait until after the holidays to make such a disruptive career decision, pushing any potential move into the new year.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Extreme Proximity to Majority:** Unlike most minority situations, the government is on the cusp of a majority (2 seats away). This dramatically amplifies the incentive structure for both the governing party (to poach) and potential defectors (who hold immense leverage).
*   **A "Hot" Political Environment:** The situation is not static. Two departures have just occurred, creating a dynamic and unstable environment where norms are temporarily suspended. This is fundamentally different from the "cruising altitude" of a mid-term parliament.
*   **Polarizing Opposition Leadership:** The context suggests Poilievre's leadership style is a key driver of dissent. This provides a specific, person-centric reason for defection, which is a more powerful catalyst than vague, long-term party drift.
*   **New Government, New Leader:** The presence of a new Prime Minister (Mark Carney) may offer a more appealing landing spot for disaffected MPs than an established, long-serving leader would. A defector can frame their move as joining a "fresh start."

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Starting from the "departures in a volatile minority parliament" reference class, a prior of ~40% seems reasonable, with a low equivalent n (~5) to reflect the high uncertainty and small sample size of the reference class.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑ Large) The government's intense and specific need for just two seats creates a buyer's market for wavering MPs.
    *   (↑ Moderate) The two recent departures have broken the dam, creating clear momentum and making a third departure far more likely than the first.
    *   (↑ Moderate) Pre-existing and ongoing reports of deep ideological rifts within the Conservative caucus provide a strong motive.
    *   (↓ Small) The short time window ending with the holidays might encourage delay, and party discipline will deter some, but likely not those already considering a move.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly suggests the specific conditions of this case overwhelm the general rarity of the event. The posterior should move significantly upward from the prior.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Anonymous quotes in media from "unnamed Conservative sources" expressing frustration.
    *   An MP from the moderate wing of the Conservative party unexpectedly missing votes or events.
    *   Public praise of the Liberal budget or PM Carney by a Conservative MP.
    *   Rumors of secret meetings between a Conservative MP and the Prime Minister's Office (PMO).
    *   The Conservative party whip's office making unusually strong statements about party loyalty.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   A public statement of unity signed by the entire Conservative caucus.
    *   Pierre Poilievre making a significant speech or policy concession aimed at the moderate wing.
    *   Key moderate Conservative MPs giving media interviews strongly reaffirming their loyalty.
    *   The Liberal government securing budget support from another opposition party (e.g., NDP, Bloc), reducing the urgency to find defectors.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Hidden Information:** The final decision to defect or resign is intensely personal and private. Negotiations would be highly secret, meaning there may be no public indicators before an announcement.
*   **Misinformation Risk:** Either the Liberal or Conservative parties could strategically leak false rumors to pressure MPs or create a false impression of stability/instability.
*   **Definition of "Resignation":** The criteria are clear, but an MP announcing an *intention* to resign in the future (e.g., "I will not run again and will step down in January") would not trigger a "Yes," but could be misreported as such.
*   **Short Timeline:** The ~6-week window is very short. Political and personal logistics for such a major move could easily push the event past the January 1 deadline, even if the decision is made in principle during this period.
*   **Domino Effect Fallacy:** While momentum is real, it's not guaranteed. The first two departures might represent the full extent of the dissent, effectively "lancing the boil."

**Final Research Summary:** The base rate for MP departures is low, but the current political context is exceptional. A highly motivated Liberal government on the verge of a majority, combined with deep, visible dissent in the Conservative caucus and the momentum from two recent departures, creates a uniquely volatile environment where another departure before year-end is highly plausible.

To forecast the probability of another Canadian MP defecting or resigning before 2026, we will follow the structured Bayesian reasoning process outlined.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate for MP departures in a typical four-year Canadian parliament is approximately 10-15 departures, translating to a 25-35% probability for a 1.5-month window. However, given the context of a minority government and recent political events, a more appropriate base rate is the 35-45% range for departures in the first year of a minority parliament. Additionally, considering the recent clustered departures, a conditional base rate of 50-60% is plausible. For this analysis, we will start with a prior probability of 50% to reflect the heightened likelihood due to recent events and the minority government context.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The current situation involves a minority government, which historically sees more political maneuvering and departures. The recent departures of two MPs align with the pattern of clustered political exits.
   - Differences: The Liberal government is just two seats away from a majority, creating a strong incentive for further defections. The recent departures and internal dissent within the Conservative Party further differentiate this situation from a typical minority government scenario.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Government's Quest for a Majority (Large ↑):** The Liberal Party's need for just two more seats to secure a majority increases the likelihood of further defections. P(E | H) is high because the government has strong incentives to attract defectors.
   - **Conservative Internal Dissent (Moderate-to-Large ↑):** Reports of ideological rifts within the Conservative Party increase the probability of further departures. P(E | H) is higher than P(E | ~H) due to existing dissatisfaction.
   - **Recent Departures (Moderate ↑):** The recent defections create momentum and reduce psychological barriers for others considering a move. P(E | H) is higher as the environment is conducive to further exits.
   - **Conservative Party Discipline (Moderate ↓):** The party's efforts to prevent further departures act as a deterrent. P(E | ~H) is higher due to potential consequences for defectors.
   - **Short Time Window (Small ↓):** The limited time frame before the end of the year may delay decisions, slightly reducing the probability of immediate departures.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Starting with a prior probability of 50%, the evidence largely supports an increase in the likelihood of another departure. The government's need for a majority, internal dissent, and recent departures all contribute positively, while party discipline and the short time window slightly counterbalance these factors.
   - Posterior odds = Prior odds × Likelihood ratio. Given the strong positive evidence, the posterior probability should increase significantly from the prior.
   - Posterior probability is adjusted upwards, reflecting the compelling evidence of potential further departures.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence Risk: The forecast might overestimate the likelihood due to recent events. Consideration of the Conservative Party's discipline and the short time window is crucial.
   - Alternative Scenario: The Conservative Party successfully quells dissent, and no further departures occur before the deadline. This scenario is plausible if party discipline is effective.
   - Adjustments: Given the strong evidence but acknowledging potential deterrents, a slight downward adjustment from the initial posterior probability is warranted.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Considering the base rate, evidence, and potential counterarguments, the final calibrated probability reflects a high likelihood of another MP departure before 2026.

Final: 65%

# Will another Canadian MP defect or resign before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to establish a prior probability for an MP defection or resignation in the next ~3 weeks (from Dec 11 to Dec 31, 2025).

The most relevant reference class is the rate of MP departures in the early months of a minority parliament, particularly following recent defections/resignations. From the research report:
- In a typical four-year parliament, there are roughly 10-15 departures out of 338 MPs
- This yields approximately one departure every 3-4 months
- For minority parliaments in their first year, the rate is higher, estimated at 35-45% for a ~6-week window
- When departures occur in clusters, the probability of a third departure within 6-8 weeks of the first two is estimated at 50-60%

Given that we've already seen two departures in early November (d'Entremont crossing the floor and Jeneroux resigning), and we're looking at a period about 5-6 weeks after these events, I'll use the "clustered departures" reference class as my prior.

**Prior probability: 55%** (mid-point of the 50-60% range for clustered departures)

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- We're in a minority parliament situation where political instability is higher
- Two departures have already occurred, creating momentum for potential additional departures
- There's documented internal dissent within the Conservative Party
- The government is actively seeking to secure a majority

**Differences from base case:**
- The Liberal government is unusually close to a majority (just 2 seats away), creating stronger incentives for poaching MPs
- The specific leadership of Pierre Poilievre appears to be a significant factor driving dissent
- The timing includes the holiday period (Dec 11-31), which might reduce the likelihood of major political moves
- The budget vote creates a specific pressure point/catalyst for potential defections

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Liberal government is just 2 seats away from a majority**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.9) - If another defection/resignation occurs, it's highly likely to be in a context where the government is aggressively pursuing a majority
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.5) - Even without another defection, we'd still observe this proximity to majority
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.8 (strongly increases probability)

**Evidence 2: Two recent departures in early November**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.9) - If another defection occurs, we'd expect to see previous departures creating momentum
- P(E|~H): High (~0.7) - These departures happened regardless, but might represent the full extent of dissent
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.3 (moderately increases probability)

**Evidence 3: Reports of Conservative MPs doubting Poilievre's leadership**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.9) - If another defection occurs, we'd expect to see internal dissent
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.6) - Some dissent might exist without leading to defections
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.5 (moderately increases probability)

**Evidence 4: Holiday period timing (Dec 11-31)**
- P(E|H): Moderate (~0.5) - If a defection occurs, it might happen despite the holiday timing
- P(E|~H): High (~0.8) - If no defection occurs, the holiday timing could be a contributing factor
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.63 (moderately decreases probability)

**Evidence 5: Conservative Party applying pressure/consequences to potential defectors**
- P(E|H): Moderate (~0.6) - If a defection occurs, it would be despite party pressure
- P(E|~H): High (~0.8) - Party discipline might successfully prevent further departures
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.75 (slightly decreases probability)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 55:45 (or 1.22:1)

First update (Liberal government close to majority):
Posterior odds = 1.22 × 1.8 = 2.2
Posterior probability = 2.2/(1+2.2) ≈ 69%

Second update (Recent departures):
Posterior odds = 2.2 × 1.3 = 2.86
Posterior probability = 2.86/(1+2.86) ≈ 74%

Third update (Conservative internal dissent):
Posterior odds = 2.86 × 1.5 = 4.29
Posterior probability = 4.29/(1+4.29) ≈ 81%

Fourth update (Holiday timing):
Posterior odds = 4.29 × 0.63 = 2.7
Posterior probability = 2.7/(1+2.7) ≈ 73%

Fifth update (Conservative Party pressure):
Posterior odds = 2.7 × 0.75 = 2.03
Posterior probability = 2.03/(1+2.03) ≈ 67%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

Potential blind spots in my analysis:
- I may be overestimating the "cluster effect" - the first two departures might represent the full extent of dissent
- The holiday period might be a stronger deterrent than I've accounted for
- I might be underestimating the effectiveness of Conservative Party discipline
- The research report might overstate the level of internal dissent within the Conservative Party
- The short timeframe (3 weeks) significantly reduces the probability compared to longer periods

Alternative forecast: A more conservative estimate might be around 40%, arguing that:
- The two departures already "cleared the air" of the most disaffected MPs
- The holiday period makes major political moves unlikely
- Conservative leadership has likely strengthened party discipline after the first two departures
- MPs considering defection might strategically wait until after the new year

Rebuttal to alternative: While these points have merit, they underweight the extraordinary incentives at play with the Liberals so close to a majority, and the documented internal dissent within the Conservative Party.

Given these considerations, I should adjust my forecast downward slightly to account for the short timeframe and holiday period.

## 6. Final Forecast

After considering the base rate, evidence, and potential blind spots, I believe the probability of another Canadian MP defecting or resigning before 2026 is:

Final: 65%

Here is my probabilistic forecast reasoning.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The question asks about the probability of a Canadian Member of Parliament (MP) defecting or resigning within a specific ~6-week window (Nov 18 - Dec 31, 2025). I will select a base rate based on departures during politically volatile periods.

*   **Reference Class:** The most appropriate reference class is not the average departure rate over a full parliament, but the rate during the unstable period of a new minority government, especially one where recent departures have already occurred.
*   **Reasoning:** The research report notes that departures often happen in clusters and that minority governments are inherently less stable. The two recent departures (d'Entremont and Jeneroux) strongly suggest we are in a "hot" political environment where the normal base rates do not apply. A standard minority government might see a departure every 6-9 months. The fact that two have just happened suggests the conditional probability of a third is much higher.
*   **Initial Prior:** I will start with a prior probability of **40%**. This reflects the elevated risk associated with a new minority government (as suggested by the report's 35-45% range for this reference class), providing a solid but conservative starting point before considering the more extreme evidence of this specific case. In odds, this is 0.40 / 0.60 = 0.67.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

The current situation differs from a typical minority government scenario in several critical ways:

*   **Proximity to Majority:** The Liberal government is reportedly just two seats away from a stable majority. This is an exceptionally rare and powerful distinction. It transforms the government's general desire for stability into an urgent, achievable goal, dramatically increasing the incentive to "poach" MPs.
*   **Momentum:** Two departures have just occurred. The first (d'Entremont's defection) provides a "proof of concept" for others, while the second (Jeneroux's resignation under pressure) signals that internal Conservative tensions are at a breaking point. This is fundamentally different from a static situation.
*   **Specific Driver:** The dissent is explicitly linked to the leadership of Pierre Poilievre. This provides a clear, ongoing "push" factor for disaffected MPs, which is a more potent catalyst than vague ideological drift.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will evaluate the key pieces of evidence to update the prior.

*   **Evidence 1: Two recent departures (d'Entremont and Jeneroux).**
    *   P(E | H): If another MP is going to leave (H), it is highly probable that this would be preceded by other signs of instability, such as the first two departures. This is a classic "smoke and fire" signal.
    *   P(E | ~H): If no one else is leaving (~H), it's possible the first two were isolated cases, but it's less likely. They are more likely symptoms of a wider problem.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Strongly greater than 1. This evidence significantly increases the probability.
*   **Evidence 2: The Liberal government is only two seats from a majority.**
    *   P(E | H): If a defection is to occur (H), it is much more likely in a situation where the governing party has an immense and immediate incentive to make it happen. The value of a single MP is astronomically high.
    *   P(E | ~H): In a typical minority government where the gap is 10-20 seats, the incentive to poach any single MP is far lower.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Strongly greater than 1. This is the most powerful piece of evidence.
*   **Evidence 3: The short timeline (resolves Dec 31, 2025).**
    *   P(E | H): If an MP is going to leave (H), the impending holiday break is a major logistical and personal hurdle. The effective political window likely closes when Parliament rises around mid-December. This makes an announcement *within the window* less likely.
    *   P(E | ~H): If no MP leaves (~H), the short timeline is a perfectly good explanation. They may have decided to wait until the new year.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Less than 1. This is the strongest piece of evidence against the event occurring within the specified timeframe.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)

I will conceptually update my prior based on the evidence.

1.  **Start with Prior:** 40% (Odds: 0.67).
2.  **Update for Momentum & Motive:** The two recent departures and the specific dissent against the leader are powerful signals that this is not a typical situation. This evidence is strong enough to suggest we are in a rare "departure cluster." I'll apply a combined likelihood ratio of ~2.5 for these factors.
    *   Posterior Odds = 0.67 × 2.5 = 1.675
    *   New Probability = 1.675 / 2.675 ≈ 63%
3.  **Update for Extreme Incentive Structure:** Now, I'll factor in the most unusual part of this case: the government being on the cusp of a majority. This creates a "buyer's market" for MPs and dramatically increases the chances of a "deal" being made. This warrants another strong update, with a likelihood ratio of ~2.0.
    *   Posterior Odds = 1.675 × 2.0 = 3.35
    *   New Probability = 3.35 / 4.35 ≈ 77%
4.  **Update for Timeline Constraint:** Finally, I must account for the very short time remaining, especially with the parliamentary session ending mid-December. This is a significant constraint. A deal might be struck, but the announcement could be delayed until January. This argues for a significant downward adjustment. I'll use a likelihood ratio of 0.5.
    *   Posterior Odds = 3.35 × 0.5 = 1.675
    *   New Probability = 1.675 / 2.675 ≈ 63%

The resulting probability is significantly higher than the base rate, reflecting the extraordinary political circumstances, but is tempered by the very real constraint of the short timeline.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My forecast of ~63% could be wrong if I am overestimating the number of genuinely disaffected Conservative MPs. It's possible that d'Entremont and Jeneroux were the only two, and the party has now successfully imposed discipline on the rest of the caucus through the "hardball tactics" mentioned in the report. The remaining MPs might be too risk-averse to make such a move, especially right before the holidays. An alternative forecast of ~35% would be plausible if one believes the crisis has been contained and the timeline is too prohibitive for such a complex political maneuver. However, I believe the sheer size of the prize for the Liberals (a majority government) and the clear motive for dissent make it more likely than not that they will find at least one more MP willing to move, and the budget vote provides a powerful catalyst to force the issue before the holiday break.

### 6. Final Forecast

The base rate for such an event is low, but the current context is exceptional. A powerful "pull" from a Liberal party desperate for a majority, a strong "push" from dissent within the Conservative party, and the momentum from two recent departures create a perfect storm. While the short timeline is a major obstacle, the pressure of an imminent budget vote could serve as a catalyst to force a decision. Weighing these factors, I assess the probability of another MP defecting or resigning before 2026 to be significantly more likely than not.

Final: 63%
