### Reference class & base rates
1.  **U.S. agricultural import bans for major animal diseases:** This is the most relevant class. Bans due to highly contagious or economically devastating diseases like Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD) or Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) are typically measured in years or even decades. The U.S. ban on UK beef due to BSE lasted over 20 years. The re-emergence of an eradicated pest like New World Screwworm (NWS) is treated with similar gravity. **Base rate for lifting such a ban within 8 months (May 2025 - Jan 2026) is low, likely <15%.**
2.  **Previous New World Screwworm eradication campaigns:** Historically, pushing back NWS has been a multi-year, country-by-country effort. Eradicating it from the U.S. took decades, and establishing the current barrier zone in Panama was a long-term international project. A single outbreak, like the one in the Florida Keys in 2016, took 6 months to declare eradicated *after the last detection*. **This suggests a base rate for resolving a cross-border, multi-case outbreak in under a year is very low, perhaps <10%.**
3.  **Short-term/regional U.S. agricultural import suspensions:** The U.S. sometimes imposes shorter, more targeted bans, for example, on poultry from a specific region due to an avian influenza outbreak. These can last a few months. However, the NWS situation has already proven more difficult than a localized outbreak, given the failed reopening in July. This reference class seems less applicable.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-07-09** Re-imposition of import suspension — ↓ — The ban was lifted for only two days before a new NWS case forced its reinstatement, indicating the outbreak was not under control and undermining confidence.
*   **2025-08-15** USDA announces $100M investment and new Texas facility — ↓ — A major, long-term investment signals the U.S. is preparing for a multi-year effort, not expecting a quick resolution from Mexico's side.
*   **2025-11-04** USDA Secretary states "no time frame for reopening" — ↓ — Official confirmation that there is no clear path to reopening in the near term, despite diplomatic language about being "pleased with Mexico's efforts."
*   **2025-11-04** USDA Secretary notes "every day...we get a little bit closer" — ↑ — A minor positive signal of ongoing cooperation and progress, but it is vague and likely intended to manage political and industry pressure.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Biological Containment & Eradication (Large):** The primary driver. Reopening is contingent on Mexico demonstrating, to the USDA's satisfaction, that the NWS outbreak is fully contained and on a clear path to eradication. This requires a sustained period (multiple screwworm life cycles, ~21 days each) with no new detections in the export region.
2.  **Sterile Fly Production & Dispersal (Large):** The Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) is the only effective eradication method. The ability to produce and disperse tens of millions of sterile flies weekly to overwhelm the wild population is the key operational lever. The announced facility upgrades will not be complete before the resolution date.
3.  **USDA/APHIS Bureaucratic Process (Moderate):** The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has a rigorous, science-based process for lifting bans. It involves data review, risk assessment, and likely on-site verification by U.S. personnel. This process is inherently cautious and time-consuming, adding weeks or months to the timeline even after the biological situation improves.
4.  **Economic Pressure (Moderate):** The ban has significant economic costs for Mexican cattle ranchers and U.S. feedlot operators who rely on Mexican feeder calves. This creates strong lobbying pressure for reopening, but this pressure is secondary to the catastrophic risk NWS poses to the entire U.S. livestock industry.
5.  **Political & Diplomatic Relations (Small):** While high-level cooperation is necessary (as seen in the April agreements), the final decision will be technical, not political. Poor relations could slow things down, but good relations cannot override a negative biosecurity assessment.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Failed Reopening:** Unlike a standard, continuous ban, the July 7-9 "false start" is a powerful negative update. It demonstrates that the initial assessment of the situation was overly optimistic and that the pest is more entrenched than previously believed.
*   **Major U.S. Onshoring of a Solution:** The August announcement of a new sterile fly facility in Texas is a significant strategic shift. It shows the U.S. is not just assisting Mexico but is building its own long-term infrastructure to manage the threat, implying a lack of confidence in a rapid, Mexico-led solution.
*   **Known Eradication Technology:** Unlike novel diseases, there is a proven playbook (SIT) for eradicating NWS. This could theoretically speed up the process compared to a disease with no cure. However, the issue is one of scale, logistics, and execution, not scientific discovery.
*   **Extreme Proximity and Trade Volume:** The land border and the sheer volume of live animal trade create a uniquely high-risk pathway for pest re-introduction, justifying an extremely conservative stance from the USDA compared to bans on trade from more distant countries.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A prior of ~15% "Yes" seems appropriate, based on reference classes of major animal disease bans, which rarely resolve in under a year. The equivalent n is moderate (e.g., n=10), reflecting some ambiguity in the reference class.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↓ Large) The failed reopening in July is strong evidence that initial containment efforts were insufficient.
    *   (↓ Large) The U.S. committing $100M and building a new domestic facility is a clear signal of a long-term strategy, not a short-term fix.
    *   (↓ Moderate) The official "no time frame" statement from the USDA Secretary in November confirms the lack of a near-term resolution pathway.
    *   (↑ Small) Diplomatic statements about "making progress" carry little weight against the operational and biological realities.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly reinforces the prior belief that this will be a lengthy ban. The posterior probability of a "Yes" resolution should be revised significantly downward from the initial prior.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Joint USDA-Mexico announcement of a specific, multi-week period with zero new NWS detections in northern Mexico.
    *   Announcement of a formal, phased reopening plan (e.g., allowing imports from certified NWS-free zones).
    *   Reports of USDA/APHIS technical teams conducting successful verification visits in Mexico.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Any official report of a new NWS case, particularly north of the current outbreak zone.
    *   Reports of logistical or political friction in the joint eradication program.
    *   U.S. industry groups (e.g., NCBA) issuing statements preparing members for a multi-quarter or year-long suspension.
    *   The upcoming holiday period (Christmas/New Year's) passing with no major announcements, as government action slows.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Ambiguity of "Reopen":** The resolution criteria could be met by a partial or conditional reopening (e.g., only from certain Mexican states, only for specific classes of cattle). This is a key definitional risk.
*   **Information Asymmetry:** Public information is likely filtered and delayed. The true biological situation on the ground in Mexico may be better or worse than what is conveyed in official press releases.
*   **Holiday Slowdown:** The resolution window (Dec 11 - Dec 31) is a period of significantly reduced government activity in both countries. The bureaucratic inertia against a major policy change during this time is substantial.
*   **"Black Swan" Event:** A sudden, unexpected political deal could be struck, but this is highly unlikely as the USDA's regulatory decisions are legally bound to scientific risk assessment, not political whim.

**Final Research Summary:** The biological and bureaucratic timelines required to control a New World Screwworm outbreak and verify its containment make a reopening of the border before 2026 highly improbable. The failed reopening in July and the subsequent U.S. investment in a long-term domestic solution strongly indicate this will be a protracted issue.

To forecast the probability of the United States reopening cattle imports from Mexico before 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most relevant base rate for this event is the historical frequency of lifting U.S. agricultural import bans due to major animal diseases. These bans, especially for highly contagious or economically devastating diseases, typically last for years. The base rate for lifting such a ban within 8 months is low, likely less than 15%. This is informed by historical cases like the BSE ban on UK beef, which lasted over 20 years, and the multi-year efforts required to eradicate New World screwworm (NWS) in the past.

**Initial Prior:** 15% probability that the ban will be lifted before 2026.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
**Similarities:** 
- The current situation involves a highly contagious pest (NWS) similar to other major animal disease outbreaks.
- Historical eradication efforts for NWS have been lengthy, involving multi-year campaigns.

**Differences:**
- The U.S. has already attempted to reopen the border once, albeit unsuccessfully, which is not typical for such bans.
- There is a known eradication method (Sterile Insect Technique) that could theoretically expedite the process, although it requires significant logistical execution.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Failed Reopening in July:** Strong evidence against a quick resolution. Likelihood ratio significantly favors the ban not being lifted soon.
- **$100M Investment and New Facility:** Indicates a long-term strategy, decreasing the probability of a quick resolution.
- **USDA Secretary's Statement of No Time Frame:** Confirms the lack of a near-term resolution, further decreasing the probability.
- **Positive Diplomatic Language:** Slightly increases probability but is outweighed by operational realities.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Using the prior probability of 15% and considering the evidence:
- **Failed Reopening:** Strong negative update.
- **Investment and Facility:** Strong negative update.
- **No Time Frame Statement:** Moderate negative update.
- **Diplomatic Language:** Minor positive update.

Given the strong negative evidence, the posterior probability should be revised downward significantly from the initial prior.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** The forecast might underestimate the possibility of a rapid diplomatic or technical breakthrough, but historical precedent and current evidence strongly suggest a lengthy process.
- **Alternative Scenarios:** A sudden eradication success or a political decision could change the outcome, but these are unlikely given the USDA's science-based approach.
- **Tail Risks:** Consideration of a "black swan" event is necessary, but the probability remains low.

### 6. Final Forecast
Considering the base rate, evidence, and red team thinking, the probability of the U.S. reopening cattle imports from Mexico before 2026 is low. The evidence strongly supports a lengthy ban.

Final: 5%

# Will the United States reopen cattle imports from Mexico before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to establish a prior probability for the U.S. reopening cattle imports from Mexico within the next ~3 weeks (from Dec 11, 2025 to Jan 1, 2026).

The most relevant reference classes are:
- Major agricultural import bans due to serious animal diseases/pests
- Previous New World Screwworm (NWS) eradication campaigns
- The timeline of similar agricultural import suspensions

Based on historical patterns, major animal disease import bans typically last years rather than months. The NWS is considered an extremely serious pest that was previously eradicated from the U.S. after decades of effort. Even the 2016 Florida Keys outbreak took 6 months to declare eradicated after the last detection.

Given that:
- The ban has already been in place for 7 months (since May 2025)
- There was a failed reopening attempt in July 2025
- NWS eradication typically requires multiple pest life cycles with no new detections

**Prior probability: 10%**

This reflects the low historical likelihood of resolving such a serious agricultural pest issue in under a year, especially with only 3 weeks remaining in the resolution window.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- This is a serious agricultural pest with potential for devastating economic impact
- The U.S. has a history of being extremely cautious with agricultural biosecurity
- The standard protocol requires verified eradication before reopening borders
- The ban involves a major trading partner with significant economic interests

**Key differences:**
- The failed July reopening attempt is a negative signal not present in many reference cases
- The U.S. has announced a $100M investment in a new Texas facility, suggesting a long-term approach
- The USDA Secretary's November statement explicitly mentioned "no time frame for reopening"
- The resolution window includes the holiday period when government action typically slows
- There is a proven eradication technology (Sterile Insect Technique), unlike some novel disease outbreaks

These differences mostly point toward a lower probability than the base rate, with the exception of the existence of a proven eradication method.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Failed reopening in July 2025**
- P(E|H): If the border will reopen by Jan 1, 2026, how likely was the July reopening to fail? Moderately likely (~40%) - even if progress was being made, setbacks are common.
- P(E|~H): If the border will not reopen by Jan 1, 2026, how likely was the July reopening to fail? Very likely (~90%) - a failed reopening indicates the problem is more severe than initially assessed.
- Likelihood ratio: 0.44 (evidence against reopening)

**Evidence 2: $100M investment and new Texas facility announcement (August 2025)**
- P(E|H): If reopening will occur soon, how likely would the U.S. be to make this major investment? Low (~20%) - such investments are typically made for long-term issues.
- P(E|~H): If reopening will not occur soon, how likely would the U.S. be to make this investment? High (~80%) - this signals preparation for a prolonged situation.
- Likelihood ratio: 0.25 (strong evidence against reopening)

**Evidence 3: "No time frame for reopening" statement (November 2025)**
- P(E|H): If reopening will occur within weeks, how likely would this statement be? Very low (~10%) - officials would likely hint at the timeline if reopening was imminent.
- P(E|~H): If reopening will not occur soon, how likely would this statement be? Very high (~95%) - this is exactly what officials would say for a prolonged ban.
- Likelihood ratio: 0.11 (very strong evidence against reopening)

**Evidence 4: "Every day we get closer" statement (November 2025)**
- P(E|H): If reopening will occur soon, how likely would this statement be? High (~80%) - officials would want to signal progress.
- P(E|~H): If reopening will not occur soon, how likely would this statement be? Moderate (~60%) - diplomatic language is common even when progress is slow.
- Likelihood ratio: 1.33 (weak evidence for reopening)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 10:90 (0.11)

Update on Evidence 1 (failed July reopening):
- Posterior odds = 0.11 × 0.44 = 0.048
- Posterior probability = 0.048 / (1 + 0.048) ≈ 4.6%

Update on Evidence 2 ($100M investment):
- Posterior odds = 0.048 × 0.25 = 0.012
- Posterior probability = 0.012 / (1 + 0.012) ≈ 1.2%

Update on Evidence 3 ("no time frame" statement):
- Posterior odds = 0.012 × 0.11 = 0.0013
- Posterior probability = 0.0013 / (1 + 0.0013) ≈ 0.13%

Update on Evidence 4 ("getting closer" statement):
- Posterior odds = 0.0013 × 1.33 = 0.0017
- Posterior probability = 0.0017 / (1 + 0.0017) ≈ 0.17%

This extremely low probability seems too confident given the inherent uncertainties. Let me reconsider with a more conservative approach.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

My analysis may be overly pessimistic for several reasons:

1. **Information asymmetry**: There could be significant progress in Mexico's eradication efforts not reflected in public statements.

2. **Political pressure**: The economic impact on both sides of the border creates strong incentives to find a solution, especially if the outbreak is contained to specific regions.

3. **Partial reopening possibility**: The question resolves as "Yes" even if only limited imports from certain regions resume.

4. **Overconfidence in evidence interpretation**: My likelihood ratios may be too extreme given the limited information available.

5. **Precedent of the July reopening attempt**: The fact that officials were willing to attempt reopening once suggests they might do so again if conditions improve.

Given these considerations, I should adjust my extremely low posterior probability upward to account for these uncertainties and alternative scenarios.

## 6. Final Forecast

After considering both the evidence and potential blind spots in my analysis, I believe the probability of the U.S. reopening cattle imports from Mexico before January 1, 2026 is very low, but not as extreme as my initial calculation suggested.

The key factors weighing against reopening are:
- The failed July reopening attempt
- The major long-term investment in domestic infrastructure
- The explicit "no timeframe" statement from November
- The approaching holiday period when government action typically slows
- The biological reality that eradication requires multiple pest life cycles with no new detections

However, I must account for:
- Potential diplomatic or economic pressures not visible in public statements
- The possibility of a partial or regional reopening
- The inherent uncertainty in predicting government decisions

Balancing these considerations, I arrive at a final forecast of 3%.

Final: 3%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The most appropriate reference class is major agricultural import bans by the U.S. due to significant animal disease or pest outbreaks. Examples include Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD), and previous large-scale pest eradications. These events are characterized by:
1.  High economic stakes for the U.S. agricultural sector.
2.  A requirement for scientific proof of containment/eradication, not just diplomatic assurances.
3.  A cautious, time-consuming bureaucratic process for lifting the ban.

Historically, such bans are measured in years, not months. The U.S. ban on UK beef for BSE lasted over 20 years. Even a more localized pest outbreak, like the New World Screwworm (NWS) in the Florida Keys in 2016, took six months to declare eradicated *after the last detection*.

Given that the ban was imposed in May 2025, the question asks if it will be lifted within about 8 months. Based on the reference class of major animal biosecurity events, the probability of resolution within such a short timeframe is very low. A reasonable prior probability P(H) for the ban being lifted before 2026, established at the beginning of the incident, would be around **10%**.

Prior Odds: P(H) / P(~H) = 0.10 / 0.90 = 1/9.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities:**
*   The event involves a pest (NWS) that was previously eradicated from the U.S. and poses a catastrophic economic threat to the livestock industry, aligning it with the most serious reference class cases (like FMD).
*   The solution requires a complex, large-scale biological control program (Sterile Insect Technique), which is logistically intensive and takes time to show results.

**Differences:**
*   **Failed Reopening:** This situation is significantly worse than a standard, continuous ban. The attempt to reopen on July 7 and the immediate reimposition on July 9 is a powerful negative signal. It indicates that the initial assessment by authorities was wrong and the outbreak was more severe or widespread than believed. This makes a quick resolution *less* likely than the base case.
*   **Proximity and Trade Volume:** The U.S.-Mexico land border has an immense volume of traffic, making the risk of re-introduction exceptionally high. This justifies an even more cautious and prolonged approach from the USDA than a ban on a distant trading partner.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

Let H be the hypothesis "The U.S. reopens cattle imports from Mexico before 2026."

*   **Evidence 1: Failed reopening in July 2025.**
    *   P(E1 | H): The likelihood of a major setback like a failed reopening, if the situation were truly on track for a full resolution within 5 months, is very low.
    *   P(E1 | ~H): The likelihood of a failed reopening, if the outbreak is persistent and will not be controlled by year-end, is high. It's a classic sign of an underestimated problem.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio << 1. This evidence strongly decreases the probability.**

*   **Evidence 2: USDA announces a $100M investment and a new Texas-based sterile fly facility in August 2025.**
    *   P(E2 | H): The likelihood of the U.S. committing to a major, long-term domestic infrastructure project if they expected the problem in Mexico to be solved in the short term is extremely low.
    *   P(E2 | ~H): The likelihood of this investment if the U.S. anticipates a multi-year struggle to contain NWS at the border is very high. This is a strategic, long-term response.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio <<< 1. This is very strong evidence that decreases the probability.**

*   **Evidence 3: As of November 4, 2025, the USDA Secretary states there is "no time frame for reopening."**
    *   P(E3 | H): The likelihood of this statement less than two months before the deadline, if a reopening were imminent, is very low. Officials would likely be using more forward-looking language.
    *   P(E3 | ~H): This statement is perfectly consistent with a long-term ban.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio << 1. This evidence decreases the probability.**

*   **Evidence 4: The current date is December 11, 2025.**
    *   The resolution window is now only 20 days away and includes the Christmas and New Year's holidays, a period of significant government slowdown.
    *   P(E4 | H): The likelihood that a major policy reversal like this would occur with no prior announcement or phased plan being made public by December 11 is almost zero. Such a decision requires public notice, coordination, and preparation at border crossings.
    *   P(E4 | ~H): The likelihood of continued silence if the ban is not being lifted is 1.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio is extremely small. This is the most powerful piece of evidence.**

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)

Starting with a prior of 10% (1:9 odds against).

1.  **Prior Odds:** 1:9 against.
2.  **Update with Failed Reopening & US Investment:** These two pieces of evidence are very strong signals that the problem is severe and long-term. Combined, they might have a likelihood ratio of 1/20 or lower.
    *   Posterior Odds ≈ (1/9) * (1/20) = 1/180.
    *   This drops the probability to ~0.5%.
3.  **Update with "No Time Frame" & Proximity to Deadline:** The lack of any announcement by December 11 is overwhelming evidence. The bureaucratic and biological hurdles that must be cleared cannot realistically be done in the remaining 20 days, especially over the holidays. This final piece of evidence has a likelihood ratio approaching zero.

The cumulative effect of the evidence is to drive the initial low probability down to a near-zero level. The posterior probability is extremely low.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

*   **Alternative Scenario:** Could there be a "Christmas surprise" where a political decision is made to reopen the border as a diplomatic gesture, overriding the scientific process? This is highly improbable. The USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) operates on a legal and scientific mandate to protect U.S. agriculture. A political override that risks introducing a devastating pest would be a catastrophic and unjustifiable risk with immense political fallout.
*   **Misinterpretation of "Reopen":** Could a very minor, conditional reopening (e.g., from one certified ranch) count? While possible, even this would require a formal, public process that has not been initiated. Given the lack of any signals, this is also highly unlikely to be completed in the next 20 days.
*   **Overconfidence:** Am I being overconfident in the slowness of bureaucracy? While governments can sometimes move fast in an emergency, lifting a biosecurity ban is the opposite; the incentive structure is built around extreme caution. The risk of being wrong and letting the pest in is far greater than the risk of waiting a few more months.

The arguments for a "Yes" resolution are exceptionally weak and rely on non-standard, low-probability events. The forecast should remain very low.

### 6. Final Forecast

The initial base rate for resolving a major animal biosecurity issue within 8 months was already low, around 10%. The subsequent evidence—particularly the failed reopening in July, the U.S. commitment to a long-term domestic facility, and the simple fact that it is now mid-December with no plan announced—provides overwhelming confirmation that this is a protracted problem. The biological and bureaucratic timelines required for verification and reopening make a resolution in the next 20 days a virtual impossibility.
