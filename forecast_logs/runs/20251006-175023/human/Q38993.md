### Reference class & base rates
1.  **First-in-class novel psychiatric drug NDA filings:** Psychedelics represent a novel therapeutic class with a unique mechanism of action and administration protocol (psychedelic-assisted therapy). The base rate for a company successfully navigating Phase 3 trials and filing an NDA for a first-in-class psychiatric drug is low. Historically, only about 58% of psychiatric drugs entering Phase 3 proceed to an NDA filing, and this process often takes over 12 months from final data collection. This suggests a base rate of **~20-30%** for any single lead candidate achieving a filing within a specific calendar year post-Phase 3 initiation.
2.  **DEA rescheduling of a Schedule I substance with medical potential:** This is a rare event, driven by a lengthy scientific and administrative process. The most recent parallel is cannabis. The process from the President's directive (Oct 2022) to the start of DEA hearings (Jan 2025) has taken over two years and is not yet complete. This suggests a base rate for a substance completing the rescheduling process in any given year is **<5%**, even after a formal review has begun.
3.  **Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for non-infectious disease threats:** The EUA pathway is overwhelmingly used for threats like pandemics, chemical attacks, or nuclear incidents. Its application to a chronic, ongoing mental health crisis would be unprecedented. The base rate for an EUA being filed for a psychiatric condition is effectively **~0%**.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2024-08-09** FDA rejects Lykos Therapeutics' NDA for MDMA-assisted therapy for PTSD. ↓ — This was a major setback for the entire field, revealing the FDA's significant concerns about trial design (esp. functional unblinding), data integrity, and safety. It raises the evidentiary bar for all other psychedelic drug candidates.
*   **2024-09-26** COMPASS Pathways announces completion of enrollment for its second pivotal Phase 3 trial (COMP006) of psilocybin for Treatment-Resistant Depression (TRD). ↑ — This keeps them on track as the leading candidate for a 2025 filing. Timely enrollment is a key prerequisite for meeting data collection and analysis deadlines.
*   **2024-11-01** DEA judge postpones marijuana rescheduling hearings to early 2025. ↓ — While not directly related to psychedelics (cannabis is excluded), this reinforces the slow, deliberate, and often delayed nature of the DEA's administrative process, making the rescheduling path for any psychedelic in 2025 highly improbable.
*   **2024-12-10** DEA schedules witness testimony for marijuana rescheduling to begin January 21, 2025, and run through March. ↓ — Further illustrates the multi-month timeline for just one phase of the DEA rescheduling process, confirming this is not a viable path for a 2025 resolution for any psychedelic.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **COMPASS Pathways' Phase 3 Trial Results & Timeline (Large):** This is the single most important driver. The question's resolution hinges almost entirely on COMPASS completing its second pivotal trial, analyzing the data, and submitting an NDA for its psilocybin therapy by Dec 31, 2025. Any delays or negative results would virtually close this path.
2.  **FDA Scrutiny Post-MDMA Rejection (Large):** The FDA and its advisory committees are now highly sensitized to the unique challenges of psychedelic trials, particularly the difficulty of maintaining patient and therapist blinds. This will likely lead to more stringent reviews of any application, potentially slowing down the pre-submission and submission process for COMPASS.
3.  **Corporate/Financial Viability (Moderate):** Late-stage trials and NDA preparations are extremely expensive. While lead companies like COMPASS appear well-capitalized, any unforeseen financial strain could force them to delay a filing.
4.  **DEA Rescheduling Process Bureaucracy (Large):** The DEA's process is inherently slow and legalistic, involving recommendations from HHS/FDA, proposed rulemaking, public comment periods, and hearings. It is not designed for speed. This mechanism makes the rescheduling resolution path for any psychedelic in 2025 virtually impossible, as the prerequisite FDA approval is not in place.
5.  **Precedent for EUA (Small):** The lack of any precedent for using an EUA for a chronic mental health condition makes this pathway a long shot. It would require a radical reinterpretation of the EUA statute by federal agencies.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Psychedelic-Assisted Therapy Model:** Unlike a simple pill, these treatments involve a complex therapeutic protocol. This complicates trial design, regulatory evaluation (judging the drug vs. therapy), and raises unique safety concerns (e.g., therapist conduct), as seen in the MDMA review.
*   **Functional Unblinding:** The profound subjective effects of psychedelics make traditional double-blind trials nearly impossible. This was a core criticism of the MDMA application and remains a major methodological hurdle that any new NDA must convincingly address.
*   **Schedule I Status:** The substances in question are in the most restrictive category, creating significant logistical, financial, and political hurdles for research and development that don't exist for typical investigational drugs.
*   **Intense Public and Political Salience:** Psychedelics attract a level of media attention, patient advocacy, and political debate far exceeding that of a typical novel antidepressant. This can cut both ways, creating pressure to act but also inviting intense scrutiny.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A reasonable prior, based on the difficulty of drug development (Reference Class 1), might be around 25-35%. This acknowledges the possibility of a lead candidate succeeding while respecting the high failure rate. (Equivalent n ≈ 10).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↓ Large) The FDA's rejection of MDMA on fundamental trial design grounds significantly lowers the probability of *any* psychedelic NDA succeeding on the first pass without overwhelming data, raising the bar for a 2025 filing.
    *   (↑ Moderate) COMPASS Pathways remains on its publicly stated timeline for its Phase 3 program, keeping the primary path to a "Yes" resolution viable.
    *   (↓ Small) The demonstrated slowness of the DEA's marijuana rescheduling process effectively reduces the probability of the rescheduling path to near zero for 2025.
    *   (↓ Small) The continued absence of any serious regulatory or corporate discussion about an EUA for psychedelics confirms this path is highly improbable.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly suggests focusing exclusively on the NDA path. The major negative update from the MDMA rejection likely outweighs the positive update of COMPASS staying on schedule. The posterior should move down moderately from the prior.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   COMPASS Pathways announces positive topline data from its second Phase 3 trial (COMP006) in mid-2025.
    *   COMPASS announces a successful pre-NDA meeting with the FDA in H2 2025.
    *   FDA issues new draft guidance on psychedelic trials that provides a clear and achievable path forward.
    *   A surprise announcement of a different company's successful Phase 3 trial completion (e.g., Usona Institute).
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   COMPASS announces any delay in its trial timeline or data release.
    *   Topline data from COMPASS's trial is ambiguous or shows safety concerns.
    *   Key executives or researchers depart from COMPASS Pathways.
    *   The FDA communicates a need for additional, lengthy trials before an NDA can be considered.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Resolution Criteria Nuance:** The question resolves on *filing* an NDA or EUA, or the *completion* of rescheduling. This is a much lower bar than FDA *approval*. A company could file a weak NDA that is likely to be rejected, which would still resolve the question "Yes".
*   **Cannabis Conflation:** The provided sources are exclusively about marijuana. Marijuana is explicitly excluded from the definition of a psychedelic in the resolution criteria. The marijuana rescheduling process is only useful as a procedural analogy for the DEA; its outcome does not affect this question.
*   **Corporate Optimism:** Company-provided timelines are often best-case scenarios. Investors should be wary of taking them at face value without accounting for potential slippage.
*   **Definition of "Psychedelic":** The definition is broad and includes dissociatives like ketamine. However, ketamine (as esketamine/Spravato) is already approved, so new developments would likely involve new formulations or indications, which seem less probable to hit the 2025 timeline than the primary psilocybin candidates.

**Final Research Summary:** The resolution of this question almost entirely depends

To forecast the probability of the next step for the medical approval of psychedelics for mental health being taken in the US in 2025, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Base Rate for NDA Filing:** The base rate for a first-in-class psychiatric drug successfully navigating Phase 3 trials and filing an NDA is approximately 20-30%. This is based on historical data indicating that about 58% of psychiatric drugs entering Phase 3 proceed to an NDA filing, with the process often taking over 12 months from final data collection.
- **Base Rate for DEA Rescheduling:** The base rate for a substance completing the rescheduling process in any given year is less than 5%, given the lengthy and complex nature of the process.
- **Base Rate for EUA:** The base rate for an EUA being filed for a psychiatric condition is effectively 0%, as this would be unprecedented.

Given the focus on the NDA path as the most viable, we will use a base rate of 25% for the NDA filing as our prior probability.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** The current situation involves a novel psychiatric drug (psilocybin) undergoing Phase 3 trials, similar to the reference class.
- **Differences:** The recent rejection of MDMA by the FDA highlights increased scrutiny and challenges specific to psychedelic-assisted therapies, such as trial design and functional unblinding.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **FDA Rejection of MDMA (↓ Large):** The rejection due to trial design concerns significantly lowers the probability of any psychedelic NDA succeeding without overwhelming data. This suggests a likelihood ratio less than 1, decreasing the probability.
- **COMPASS Pathways' Progress (↑ Moderate):** COMPASS Pathways remains on track with its Phase 3 trial, which is a positive indicator. This suggests a likelihood ratio greater than 1, increasing the probability.
- **DEA Rescheduling Process (↓ Small):** The slow nature of the DEA's process and the lack of prerequisite FDA approval make this path highly improbable for 2025.
- **EUA Pathway (↓ Small):** The absence of any serious discussion about an EUA for psychedelics confirms this path is highly improbable.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
- **Prior Probability:** 25% (0.25 in probability terms)
- **Likelihood Ratio for NDA Path:** Considering the large negative impact of the FDA's MDMA rejection and the moderate positive impact of COMPASS's progress, we estimate a net likelihood ratio of approximately 0.8.
- **Posterior Odds Calculation:**
  - Prior odds = 0.25 / (1 - 0.25) = 0.333
  - Posterior odds = 0.333 × 0.8 = 0.266
  - Posterior probability = 0.266 / (1 + 0.266) ≈ 0.21 or 21%

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** The forecast accounts for both positive and negative evidence, but the potential for unforeseen regulatory or trial developments could impact the outcome.
- **Tail Risks:** A surprise positive development, such as unexpectedly favorable trial results or regulatory guidance, could increase the probability.
- **Alternative Forecast:** An alternative forecast might emphasize the potential for COMPASS to meet its timeline, suggesting a higher probability. However, the FDA's increased scrutiny tempers this optimism.

### 6. Final Forecast
- **Final Probability:** Considering the base rate, evidence, and potential risks, the final forecast is 21%.

Final: 21%

# Will the next step for medical approval of psychedelics for mental health be taken in the US in 2025?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to establish a prior probability for any of the three resolution criteria being met in 2025:
1. NDA filing for a psychedelic to treat a mental disorder
2. EUA application for a psychedelic to treat a mental disorder
3. DEA rescheduling of a psychedelic to a less restrictive schedule

Looking at the reference classes:
- First-in-class psychiatric drug NDA filings: ~20-30% chance in a given year
- DEA rescheduling of Schedule I substances: <5% in a given year
- EUA for non-infectious disease threats: ~0% (unprecedented)

Given that we need only one of these paths to succeed, and the NDA filing is the most likely path, I'll use a prior of **25%**. This reflects the base rate for a novel psychiatric drug candidate successfully navigating Phase 3 trials and filing an NDA within a specific calendar year.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- The regulatory framework remains the same (FDA approval process, DEA scheduling authority)
- The burden of proof for safety and efficacy is consistent with other psychiatric medications
- The timeline for Phase 3 trials to NDA filing is comparable to other drugs

**Key differences:**
- Psychedelics face unique challenges with blinding in clinical trials due to their obvious subjective effects
- The recent MDMA rejection has created a higher evidentiary bar specifically for psychedelics
- The therapeutic model involves drug-assisted therapy sessions rather than simple medication, complicating evaluation
- Schedule I status creates additional research and development hurdles
- Psychedelics attract unusual public and political attention, creating both pressure and scrutiny

These differences generally make approval more difficult than the typical psychiatric drug, suggesting a downward adjustment to the base rate.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: FDA's rejection of MDMA for PTSD in August 2024**
- P(E|H): If a psychedelic NDA/EUA will be filed in 2025, how likely would we see the FDA reject MDMA? Moderately likely (~40%) as the FDA might have specific concerns about MDMA while being open to other psychedelics.
- P(E|~H): If no psychedelic NDA/EUA will be filed in 2025, how likely would we see the FDA reject MDMA? Very likely (~80%) as this would indicate broader FDA concerns about the entire class.
- Likelihood ratio: 0.5 (unfavorable)
- This evidence significantly decreases the probability, as it reveals the FDA's concerns about trial design, blinding, and safety that will likely affect all psychedelic applications.

**Evidence 2: COMPASS Pathways' progress with psilocybin trials**
- P(E|H): If a psychedelic NDA will be filed in 2025, how likely would COMPASS complete enrollment for its second Phase 3 trial by Sept 2024? Very likely (~90%) as this keeps them on track.
- P(E|~H): If no psychedelic NDA will be filed in 2025, how likely would COMPASS complete enrollment by Sept 2024? Moderately likely (~50%) as enrollment completion doesn't guarantee timely data analysis or filing.
- Likelihood ratio: 1.8 (favorable)
- This evidence increases the probability, as COMPASS remains the leading candidate for a 2025 filing and is maintaining its timeline.

**Evidence 3: DEA's marijuana rescheduling timeline**
- P(E|H): If a psychedelic will be rescheduled in 2025, how likely would we see the DEA's marijuana rescheduling process extend into 2025? Somewhat likely (~60%) as both processes might face similar timelines.
- P(E|~H): If no psychedelic will be rescheduled in 2025, how likely would we see the DEA's marijuana rescheduling process extend into 2025? Very likely (~90%) as this demonstrates the DEA's slow pace.
- Likelihood ratio: 0.67 (unfavorable)
- This evidence decreases the probability of the DEA rescheduling path, showing that even with political support, the process takes years.

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior of 25% (odds of 1:3), I'll update based on the evidence:

**Update on FDA's MDMA rejection:**
- Prior odds: 1:3
- Likelihood ratio: 0.5
- Posterior odds: 0.5 × (1:3) = 1:6
- Posterior probability: 1/(1+6) = 14.3%

**Update on COMPASS Pathways' progress:**
- Prior odds: 1:6
- Likelihood ratio: 1.8
- Posterior odds: 1.8 × (1:6) = 1:3.33
- Posterior probability: 1/(1+3.33) = 23.1%

**Update on DEA's marijuana rescheduling timeline:**
- Prior odds: 1:3.33
- Likelihood ratio: 0.67
- Posterior odds: 0.67 × (1:3.33) = 1:4.97
- Posterior probability: 1/(1+4.97) = 16.8%

After incorporating all evidence, my posterior probability is approximately 17%.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the FDA's willingness to accept an NDA filing even if they have concerns (filing ≠ approval)
- I might be overlooking other companies besides COMPASS that could file an NDA
- I could be underestimating the political pressure to address mental health crises, which might accelerate processes

**Alternative scenarios:**
- COMPASS's data could be so compelling that the FDA fast-tracks the review process
- A different psychedelic (e.g., ketamine for a new indication) might have an easier path than psilocybin
- Political changes after the 2024 election could affect regulatory priorities

**Best alternative forecast:**
A more optimistic forecast might be around 30-35%, based on:
- COMPASS staying on schedule and filing by late 2025
- The FDA being willing to accept filings despite concerns (saving rejections for the review phase)
- Potential for other companies to file NDAs for different psychedelics/indications

**Rebuttal to alternative:**
The MDMA rejection revealed fundamental concerns about psychedelic trial methodology that will likely affect all applications. The timeline for COMPASS to complete trials, analyze data, and prepare an NDA by end of 2025 remains tight, especially with heightened scrutiny.

After considering these points, I'll adjust my forecast slightly upward to 20% to account for the possibility that an NDA filing (not approval) could still occur despite challenges.

## 6. Final Forecast

Final: 20%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The question can resolve through three distinct pathways: a New Drug Application (NDA) filing, an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) application, or DEA rescheduling. I will assess the base rate for each.

1.  **NDA Filing:** This is the most plausible path. The appropriate reference class is first-in-class, novel psychiatric drugs in late-stage development. Historically, the journey from completing Phase 3 trials to filing an NDA is lengthy. The research report notes that about 58% of psychiatric drugs entering Phase 3 eventually file an NDA, but doing so within a specific 12-month window post-data is challenging. A base rate of a specific company with a lead candidate filing in a given year is low. I will set the prior probability for this path at **25%**, acknowledging it's an uphill battle but with a clear frontrunner (COMPASS Pathways).

2.  **EUA Application:** The EUA pathway is designed for acute public health emergencies like pandemics or chemical attacks. Its application to a chronic mental health crisis would be unprecedented. The historical base rate for this is effectively zero. I'll set this prior at **<1%**.

3.  **DEA Rescheduling:** This is a slow, political, and bureaucratic process. For a Schedule I drug to be rescheduled, it typically requires a full medical review and recommendation from the FDA/HHS, which usually follows an NDA *approval*. The ongoing multi-year process for cannabis serves as a strong parallel. The base rate for a psychedelic completing this process in 2025 without a prior FDA approval is extremely low. I'll set this prior at **<2%**.

Combining these, the NDA path is the only one with a significant probability. Therefore, my initial prior for the overall question is **25%**.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation for psychedelics is significantly more complex than for a typical novel psychiatric drug.

*   **Similarities:** The lead candidate, COMPASS Pathways' psilocybin for Treatment-Resistant Depression, follows the standard Phase 3 trial pathway.
*   **Differences:**
    *   **Psychedelic-Assisted Therapy Model:** The FDA is evaluating a combination of a drug and a complex therapeutic protocol, not just a pill. This adds layers of complexity and scrutiny.
    *   **Functional Unblinding:** The powerful subjective effects of psychedelics make true double-blinding nearly impossible. This was a central criticism in the rejection of MDMA and remains a major methodological hurdle for any subsequent application.
    *   **FDA Precedent:** The FDA's rejection of the MDMA application in August 2024 is a critical difference. It has set a precedent, revealing the agency's deep concerns and raising the evidentiary bar for all other psychedelic developers.

These differences, particularly the recent MDMA rejection, make the path to filing an NDA in 2025 substantially more difficult and likely slower than the historical base case. This suggests the final probability should be lower than the 25% prior.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
Let H be the event that a qualifying step is taken in 2025.

*   **Evidence 1: FDA rejects MDMA application (August 2024).**
    *   This evidence is much more likely if no psychedelic filing occurs in 2025 (P(E|~H) is high) than if one does (P(E|H) is low). The rejection signals systemic challenges for the entire field, making the FDA more cautious and likely to slow down subsequent reviews. This will almost certainly delay any potential filing from late 2025 to 2026.
    *   Likelihood Ratio (P(E|H)/P(E|~H)) is significantly less than 1. This is a **strong negative update**.

*   **Evidence 2: COMPASS Pathways completes enrollment for its second Phase 3 trial on schedule (September 2024).**
    *   This is a necessary step for a 2025 filing. This evidence is more likely if H is true than if H is false (due to delays).
    *   Likelihood Ratio is greater than 1. However, this is largely "meeting expectations" rather than surprising positive news. It keeps the possibility of a 2025 filing alive but doesn't guarantee it. This is a **moderate positive update**.

*   **Evidence 3: The DEA's slow, bureaucratic process for cannabis rescheduling (ongoing).**
    *   This confirms the high barrier and slow pace of the rescheduling pathway. It effectively reduces the probability of the question resolving via this route to near zero. This is a **minor negative update** to the overall probability, as this path was already considered a long shot.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
I will start with the prior and update based on the evidence.

*   **Prior:** 25% (or 1:3 odds).
*   **Update 1 (MDMA Rejection):** This is the most important piece of new information. It significantly lowers the chances of a quick and smooth regulatory process for COMPASS. I estimate this evidence roughly halves the odds of success within the 2025 timeframe.
    *   Prior Odds: 1:3
    *   Posterior Odds after MDMA news: ≈ 1:6
    *   Posterior Probability: 1 / (1 + 6) ≈ 14%

*   **Update 2 (COMPASS Progress):** COMPASS staying on schedule is positive news. It counters some of the pessimism from the MDMA rejection. This might increase the odds by about 50%.
    *   Prior Odds: 1:6
    *   Posterior Odds after COMPASS news: (1 * 1.5) : 6 = 1.5 : 6 = 1:4
    *   **Posterior Probability:** 1 / (1 + 4) = **20%**

This result can be cross-checked by analyzing the timeline. COMPASS expects topline data in mid-2025. This leaves only ~6 months for full data analysis, a pre-NDA meeting with a now more-skeptical FDA, and compiling the massive NDA dossier. This is an extremely aggressive timeline that leaves no room for error or delay. A slip into Q1 2026 is highly probable. The probability of filing in 2025 also depends on the trial data being positive (historically ~60% chance for Phase 3 psychiatric drugs). The combination of trial risk and timeline risk makes a probability around 20% plausible.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast could be too low if COMPASS, facing investor pressure, decides to file a "good enough" NDA by the end of 2025, even if it's not perfect, just to hit the milestone. The resolution criteria is *filing*, not acceptance. This is a significant possibility that supports keeping the forecast from dropping into the single digits.

Conversely, my forecast could be too high. I'm assuming the Phase 3 trial data will be positive. There is a substantial (~40%) chance it will be negative or ambiguous, which would make the probability of a 2025 filing zero. Furthermore, corporate timelines are notoriously optimistic, and the post-MDMA regulatory environment is a major unknown that will likely cause delays. The base case for a filing, even with positive data, should probably be Q1/Q2 2026, not Q4 2025.

Considering these factors, the 20% forecast strikes a balance. It acknowledges that the primary path to a "Yes" is still viable but faces two major hurdles: the trial must succeed, and the subsequent regulatory timeline must be executed with unusual speed and efficiency.

### Final Forecast
The probability of a qualifying event in 2025 hinges almost entirely on COMPASS Pathways successfully completing its Phase 3 trial for psilocybin and filing an NDA within an extremely tight timeframe. The recent FDA rejection of MDMA has increased regulatory scrutiny, making this aggressive timeline even less likely. While the company remains on schedule with its trial, the path from data release (mid-2025) to filing by year-end is fraught with potential for delays. The alternative paths via EUA or DEA rescheduling are highly improbable. My final probability reflects the significant chance of the filing slipping into 2026.

Final: 20%
