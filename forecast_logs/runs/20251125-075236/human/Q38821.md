### Reference class & base rates
1.  **U.S. Presidential Administrations (1789-Present):** This is the most direct reference class. In over 235 years and 46 presidencies, this specific power has never been successfully invoked.
    *   **Base Rate:** 0%.
    *   **Reasoning:** Derived from 0 instances / ~60 presidential terms. This establishes an extremely strong prior against the event occurring.
    *   **Limitations:** This class includes presidents operating under vastly different political norms and constraints. It may not fully capture the unique characteristics of the actor (Donald Trump) or the current political environment.

2.  **Presidential Threats to Unilaterally Adjourn Congress:** This is a narrower, more specific class. President Trump himself threatened to use this power in April 2020 to make recess appointments while the Senate was holding pro-forma sessions.
    *   **Base Rate:** 0% (0 successful invocations / 1 known modern threat).
    *   **Reasoning:** The one recent instance of a president seriously floating the idea resulted in no action. The threat was made, but political and institutional obstacles (including from his own party) prevented its use.
    *   **Limitations:** A sample size of one is not statistically meaningful, but it provides a direct behavioral precedent for the specific actor in question.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2024-12-19** Davis Polk analysis highlights expected prompt leadership changes at federal agencies. (↑) — Signals an urgency to install loyalists, a key motive for bypassing a slow or obstructive Senate confirmation process.
*   **2024-11-08** PIMCO analysis notes Trump's strong mandate but also that narrow congressional majorities could be a check. (↔) — A mandate encourages bold action, but a narrow majority makes alienating any senators highly risky, cutting both ways.
*   **2024-11-05** Donald Trump wins the 2024 presidential election; Republicans appear poised to control both houses of Congress. (↑) — Provides the political power and opportunity to attempt such an action, though unified government could also make it unnecessary.
*   **2024-10-01** Center for American Progress report details Project 2025's goal of an "imperial presidency" via the unitary executive theory. (↑) — This provides the explicit ideological framework and justification for using novel and expansive interpretations of presidential power.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Senate Obstruction of Key Nominees (Large ↑):** This is the most likely trigger. If a small number of Republican senators join Democrats to block a high-priority, controversial nominee (e.g., for Attorney General, FBI Director, or a key regulatory post), it could create the motive for an extreme workaround.
2.  **Engineered House-Senate "Disagreement" (Moderate ↑):** The constitutional trigger requires a disagreement between the two chambers on adjournment. A Trump-loyalist House leadership could refuse to agree to an adjournment resolution passed by the Senate, manufacturing the necessary pretext for presidential intervention.
3.  **Adherence to Project 2025 Playbook (Moderate ↑):** The administration's commitment to the maximalist "unitary executive theory" as outlined in Project 2025 would drive officials to seek and use every available constitutional tool, regardless of precedent.
4.  **Institutional and Political Pushback (Large ↓):** The certainty of a constitutional crisis, immediate court challenges, and condemnation from legal scholars, the media, and potentially members of his own party serves as a powerful deterrent. Senate leadership would strongly resist such a move as it would render their "advice and consent" role moot.
5.  **Availability of Alternatives (Moderate ↓):** The administration can use "acting" officials for extended periods or simply leave positions vacant, which may be less politically costly than provoking a constitutional showdown over adjournment.
6.  **Unified Republican Government (Moderate ↓):** If Republicans control both chambers, leadership will have a strong incentive to coordinate and avoid a public "disagreement" that would create the opening for this power. They would prefer to manage confirmation disputes internally.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Unprecedented Actor:** No president in the reference class has demonstrated a comparable willingness to disregard political norms and challenge constitutional boundaries to the extent Donald Trump has.
*   **Pre-Existing Ideological Framework:** Unlike past administrations, a second Trump term would begin with a detailed, publicly available playbook (Project 2025) explicitly advocating for a maximalist use of executive power.
*   **Potential for Intra-Party Conflict:** While the base rate is set during periods of both divided and unified government, the specific trigger here may not be inter-party gridlock but *intra-party* conflict, where a Trump-loyalist House manufactures a dispute with a more establishment-minded Senate.
*   **Weaponization of Procedure:** The political environment is characterized by a greater willingness to use procedural tools (like pro-forma sessions, which prompted the 2020 threat) for partisan ends, which could also be used to create the "disagreement" pretext.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** The prior should be extremely low, anchored on the base rate of zero instances in over 235 years of U.S. history (equivalent n > 200). A starting point of <1% is reasonable.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑ Large) The existence of Project 2025 and its "unitary executive" theory provides a strong motive and justification not present for prior presidents.
    *   (↑ Moderate) Trump's personal history of challenging norms and his specific 2020 threat make him a uniquely plausible actor.
    *   (↓ Large) The high and specific procedural hurdle—a formal disagreement between the House and Senate on adjournment—remains a formidable obstacle that cannot be bypassed unilaterally.
    *   (↓ Moderate) The 2020 precedent, where Trump threatened this action but backed down when faced with institutional resistance from his own party, suggests he is not immune to political constraints.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly pushes the probability up from a near-zero prior. However, the significant procedural and political barriers mean the posterior should remain low, likely in the single digits. The update is significant in relative terms but small in absolute terms.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   A high-profile, controversial nominee (e.g., for a cabinet or judicial post) faces public opposition from 2-3 Republican senators.
    *   Trump or high-level surrogates begin publicly criticizing the Senate confirmation process as "obstructive" or "too slow."
    *   The House Freedom Caucus or allied members publicly float the idea of using adjournment scheduling as leverage against the Senate.
    *   The House and Senate pass conflicting adjournment resolutions for a recess period.
    *   White House counsel or the Department of Justice issues a legal opinion affirming the president's broad authority to adjourn Congress.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Trump's initial cabinet and key agency nominees are confirmed with minimal GOP opposition.
    *   The administration relies on appointing "acting" officials to bypass confirmation fights.
    *   House and Senate Republican leadership issue joint statements affirming a coordinated legislative calendar.
    *   Trump prioritizes other executive actions (e.g., tariffs, immigration) that do not require Senate confirmation battles.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Ambiguity of "Disagreement":** The Constitution does not define what legally constitutes a "disagreement" between the houses, creating a legal gray area the executive could exploit.
*   **Definition of "Formally Invoked":** Resolution requires formal invocation. This could be a formal proclamation, an executive order, or a letter to congressional leaders. A mere threat in a speech or on social media would not suffice.
*   **Judicial Review:** Any attempt would be immediately challenged in court. The outcome is uncertain, but the legal battle itself could outlast the recess appointment's intended duration, potentially rendering the move ineffective.
*   **Trump's Unpredictability:** The actor is famously impulsive and may defy conventional cost-benefit analysis, making his actions difficult to model based on historical precedent or rational choice theory.
*   **Black Swan Event:** An external crisis (e.g., economic collapse, major terrorist attack) could be used as a pretext to argue for the necessity of such an extraordinary action to ensure continuity of government.

**Final Research Summary:** The historical base rate for a president adjourning Congress is zero, and the procedural hurdles are immense. However, the combination of a uniquely norm-breaking president and a pre-built ideological framework (Project 2025) creates a plausible, though low-probability, scenario, contingent on severe intra-party obstruction of a critical administration nominee.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate for a U.S. president formally invoking the authority to adjourn Congress is 0%, as it has never been done in over 235 years of U.S. history. This is derived from the historical frequency of 0 instances out of approximately 60 presidential terms.
   - Initial prior: 0% (or odds of 0:1).

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The constitutional provision allowing a president to adjourn Congress remains unchanged, and the procedural hurdles are consistent with historical norms.
   - Differences: The current political environment features a president (Donald Trump) who has shown a willingness to challenge norms and a detailed ideological framework (Project 2025) advocating for expansive executive power. These factors are not present in the historical base case.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Project 2025 and Unitary Executive Theory**: This provides a strong motive and justification for using novel interpretations of presidential power. Likelihood ratio: Moderate increase.
   - **Trump's Norm-Challenging Behavior**: His history of challenging norms and the specific 2020 threat make him a uniquely plausible actor. Likelihood ratio: Moderate increase.
   - **Procedural and Political Barriers**: The requirement for a formal disagreement between the House and Senate on adjournment remains a significant obstacle. Likelihood ratio: Large decrease.
   - **2020 Precedent**: Trump's previous threat to use this power but subsequent backing down suggests he is not immune to political constraints. Likelihood ratio: Moderate decrease.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Prior odds: 0:1 (0%).
   - Evidence suggests a moderate increase in probability due to Trump's unique characteristics and Project 2025, but significant procedural and political barriers remain.
   - Posterior odds: Adjusting for evidence, the odds might increase slightly, but remain very low.
   - Posterior probability: Likely remains in the low single digits, reflecting the significant barriers.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence Check: The historical base rate is extremely low, and while Trump is a unique actor, the procedural hurdles are formidable.
   - Tail Risks: Consider the possibility of an engineered crisis or intra-party conflict that could create the necessary conditions.
   - Alternative Forecast: A forecast suggesting a higher probability might argue that Trump's unpredictability and the ideological framework make a bold move more likely. However, the procedural barriers and potential for political backlash are strong counterarguments.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Given the historical base rate, the unique characteristics of the current president, and the significant procedural hurdles, the probability remains low.
   - Final: 3%

# Will President Trump formally invoke his authority under the Constitution to adjourn Congress before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to establish a prior probability based on historical precedent of presidents using this specific constitutional power.

**Base Rate:** ~0.1% (effectively near-zero)

**Reasoning for this base rate:**
- In the entire history of the United States (235+ years, 46 presidencies), this specific constitutional power has never been successfully invoked.
- If we consider approximately 60 presidential terms with 0 instances of this power being used, this suggests a base rate approaching 0%.
- However, I'll use a slightly higher prior of 0.1% to account for the fact that rare events can happen for the first time and to avoid a complete zero probability.

**Initial prior in odds form:** 1:999 (0.1%)

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- The constitutional mechanism remains unchanged - it still requires a genuine disagreement between House and Senate on adjournment.
- Institutional barriers remain strong - such an unprecedented action would face immediate legal challenges.
- The Senate's traditional role in confirmations is constitutionally protected and senators typically resist attempts to circumvent their authority.

**Key differences from base case:**
- Donald Trump has previously threatened to use this power (April 2020) to make recess appointments, showing awareness and willingness to consider this option.
- Project 2025 explicitly advocates for expansive use of executive power under a "unitary executive" theory.
- Trump has demonstrated a greater willingness than previous presidents to test constitutional boundaries and challenge institutional norms.
- The specific political configuration (narrow Republican majorities) creates potential for intra-party conflicts that could trigger the constitutional prerequisite.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence 1: Trump's prior threat to use this power in 2020**
- P(E|H): If Trump were to invoke this power, his prior threat makes perfect sense (~90%)
- P(E|~H): Even if he doesn't invoke it, his prior threat is still somewhat expected given his style (~10%)
- Likelihood ratio: ~9:1 (moderately strong evidence in favor)

**Evidence 2: Project 2025's "imperial presidency" framework**
- P(E|H): If Trump were to invoke this power, the existence of this ideological framework is very likely (~95%)
- P(E|~H): Even if he doesn't invoke it, this framework would still exist for other executive actions (~60%)
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.6:1 (weak evidence in favor)

**Evidence 3: Unified Republican government with narrow majorities**
- P(E|H): If Trump were to invoke this power, we'd expect some intra-party conflict (~80%)
- P(E|~H): Even without invocation, narrow majorities still create tension (~70%)
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.1:1 (very weak evidence in favor)

**Evidence 4: Historical non-use of this power despite many opportunities**
- P(E|H): If Trump were to invoke this power, we'd still see the historical pattern of non-use (~100%)
- P(E|~H): If Trump doesn't invoke it, this pattern continues (~100%)
- Likelihood ratio: ~1:1 (neutral evidence)

**Evidence 5: Availability of alternative mechanisms (acting appointments, etc.)**
- P(E|H): If Trump were to invoke this power, these alternatives would still exist but be deemed insufficient (~30%)
- P(E|~H): If Trump doesn't invoke it, these alternatives would be sufficient (~90%)
- Likelihood ratio: ~1:3 (moderate evidence against)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 1:999 (0.1%)

**Update based on Trump's prior threat:**
- Prior odds × Likelihood ratio = 1:999 × 9:1 = 9:999 ≈ 9:1000
- New probability: 9/(9+1000) ≈ 0.9%

**Update based on Project 2025 framework:**
- Prior odds × Likelihood ratio = 9:1000 × 1.6:1 = 14.4:1000
- New probability: 14.4/(14.4+1000) ≈ 1.4%

**Update based on unified government with narrow majorities:**
- Prior odds × Likelihood ratio = 14.4:1000 × 1.1:1 = 15.8:1000
- New probability: 15.8/(15.8+1000) ≈ 1.6%

**Update based on alternative mechanisms:**
- Prior odds × Likelihood ratio = 15.8:1000 × 1:3 = 15.8:3000
- New probability: 15.8/(15.8+3000) ≈ 0.5%

After these updates, the posterior probability is approximately 0.5%.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the likelihood of severe intra-party conflict over a high-stakes nomination.
- The analysis assumes rational actor behavior, but Trump has sometimes acted against conventional political wisdom.
- I might be overestimating institutional resistance within the Republican Party.

**Alternative scenarios:**
- A national security crisis could create a pretext for extraordinary measures.
- A Supreme Court vacancy could create unprecedented confirmation battles.
- The House could deliberately engineer a disagreement with the Senate to enable this power.

**Best alternative forecast:**
A more aggressive forecast might place the probability at 3-5%, arguing that:
1. Trump's prior threat shows genuine interest in this mechanism
2. Project 2025 provides ideological justification
3. Trump's demonstrated willingness to test constitutional boundaries is unprecedented

**Rebuttal to alternative forecast:**
While these factors increase the probability above the historical base rate, they don't overcome:
1. The specific procedural hurdle requiring a genuine House-Senate disagreement
2. The availability of less controversial alternatives like acting appointments
3. The certain immediate legal challenges that would follow

**Adjustment based on red teaming:**
I'll adjust my forecast slightly upward to account for the unprecedented nature of Trump's approach to executive power and the explicit Project 2025 framework, but maintain a low overall probability given the significant procedural and institutional barriers.

## 6. Final Forecast

Considering the historical base rate of zero instances, Trump's unique willingness to test constitutional boundaries, the Project 2025 framework, and the significant procedural hurdles that remain, I arrive at a final probability of 1%.

Final: 1%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Reference Class:** U.S. Presidential administrations from 1789 to the present.
- **Reasoning:** The most direct and objective reference class is the history of the U.S. presidency itself. Article II, Section 3 of the Constitution has been in place since the nation's founding. In over 235 years, across 46 presidencies and approximately 60 presidential terms, this specific power has never been successfully invoked.
- **Base Rate (Prior):** The historical frequency is 0%. For forecasting, a pure 0% is not useful. Using a Laplace-style prior (like the rule of succession, 1/(N+2)), with N being ~60 presidential terms, suggests a base rate of around 1.6%. I will set a conservative and simple prior of **1%**. This establishes an extremely strong initial belief that the event will not happen.
- **Initial Odds:** 1:99 against the event.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** The fundamental constitutional structure, the separation of powers, and the institutional self-interest of Congress (particularly the Senate's prerogative of "advice and consent") remain the same as in the historical base case. These factors create immense friction against such an executive overreach.
- **Differences:** The primary difference is the specific actor, Donald Trump, and the political context.
    1.  **The Actor:** Unlike any president in the reference class, Trump has a documented history of challenging long-standing political norms and testing the boundaries of executive authority. Crucially, he is the only modern president to have explicitly threatened to use this exact power (in April 2020).
    2.  **The Ideological Framework:** A potential second Trump administration would be guided by a pre-existing, detailed plan (Project 2025) that explicitly advocates for a maximalist "unitary executive theory." This provides a ready-made justification for using novel and expansive interpretations of presidential power, something past administrations lacked.
    
These differences are significant and suggest the historical base rate is a starting point that requires substantial upward revision.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Evidence 1 (Pro): Trump's 2020 Threat and Project 2025 Playbook.**
    - This combined evidence (a specific prior threat from the actor + a detailed ideological plan) makes the scenario plausible.
    - **P(E | H):** If Trump were to adjourn Congress (H), it is very likely that he would be the kind of president who had threatened it before and was operating under an ideology like Project 2025 (E).
    - **P(E | ~H):** If Trump were not to adjourn Congress (~H), it's still plausible he would make threats for leverage and that his allies would draft aggressive plans. However, the existence of such a specific threat and plan is more indicative of the "will do it" world.
    - **Likelihood Ratio:** P(E|H) / P(E|~H) is significantly greater than 1. This evidence strongly increases the probability from the base rate.

- **Evidence 2 (Con): Institutional Barriers and the 2020 Precedent.**
    - The procedural requirement for a "disagreement" between the House and Senate is a high bar, though potentially manufacturable. More importantly, the institutional pushback from the Senate (even a Republican-led one) would be immense, as it would gut their confirmation power. In 2020, when Trump made the threat, he ultimately backed down after facing resistance from his own party's leadership.
    - **P(E | H):** If Trump were to adjourn Congress (H), he would have to overcome these known, powerful barriers (E) that have deterred him before. This is possible, but it makes the event less likely.
    - **P(E | ~H):** If Trump does not adjourn Congress (~H), it is highly likely that these institutional barriers and political calculations were the reason.
    - **Likelihood Ratio:** P(E|H) / P(E|~H) is less than 1. This evidence decreases the probability, acting as a strong check on the upward push from Evidence 1.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
- **Prior Odds:** 1:99 (1% probability).
- **Step 1: Update for the "Trump Factor" (Threats + Ideology).** This is the "what's different this time" evidence. It makes the impossible seem plausible. This is a strong update. Let's estimate this evidence increases the odds by a factor of 8.
    -   *Intermediate Odds = Prior Odds × LR = (1:99) × 8 = 8:99.*
    -   *Intermediate Probability ≈ 8 / (8 + 99) ≈ 7.5%.*
- **Step 2: Update for the "Deterrent Factor" (Institutional Pushback & 2020 Precedent).** The fact that Trump backed down before when faced with these exact barriers is a powerful counter-signal. It suggests he is not immune to political pressure from his own party's congressional leadership. This should reduce the odds, though perhaps not back to the starting point, as a second-term Trump may feel less constrained. Let's apply a downward multiplier of 0.7 (i.e., the odds are reduced by 30%).
    -   *Posterior Odds = Intermediate Odds × LR = (8:99) × 0.7 ≈ 5.6:99.*
    -   *Posterior Probability ≈ 5.6 / (5.6 + 99) ≈ 5.3%.*

This calculation suggests a final probability in the low single digits. The unique pro-arguments are strong enough to lift the probability far from the historical base rate, but the institutional counter-arguments remain formidable.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Argument for a Higher Probability (>10%):** I might be underestimating how unconstrained a second-term Trump would be. He would not face re-election, and he would likely staff his administration with loyalists fully committed to the Project 2025 agenda. The trigger—a few Republican senators blocking a critical nominee—is a very plausible scenario. In that situation, Trump might view a constitutional fight as a winning issue with his base, regardless of the institutional consequences.
- **Argument for a Lower Probability (<3%):** I might be overweighting the "Trump is different" argument and underweighting the extremely strong base rate of zero occurrences. Institutional inertia is a powerful force. The path of least resistance for a president facing a confirmation battle is to use "acting" officials, a tool that is readily available and carries far less political and constitutional risk. The Senate GOP leadership would have every incentive to manage their caucus and avoid creating the pretext for the President to seize their power.
- **Adjustment:** The red team analysis confirms the tension between a unique actor and powerful, time-tested institutional constraints. My estimate of ~5% seems to sit in a reasonable middle ground, acknowledging the real, but still remote, possibility. I will round up slightly to account for the "black swan" nature of the actor.

### Final Forecast
The final forecast synthesizes the near-zero historical base rate with the uniquely potent factors of Donald Trump's political style and the explicit ideological goals of Project 2025. While the institutional barriers that have prevented this for over two centuries remain formidable, the current actor and context create a plausible, albeit low-probability, scenario where they could be challenged. The most likely trigger would be intra-party opposition in the Senate to a high-priority nominee, leading the White House to engineer a constitutional crisis to make recess appointments.

Final: 6%
