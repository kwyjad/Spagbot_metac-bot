### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Major, Novel U.S. Tech Legislation:** This class includes laws creating new regulatory frameworks for emerging technologies (e.g., telecommunications, internet, social media, privacy). Historically, such legislation is slow and contentious. The base rate for passage within a single two-year congressional session is low, perhaps **10-20%**. It often takes multiple sessions and a strong political catalyst. For example, comprehensive federal data privacy legislation has been debated for years without passage.
2.  **National Security-Adjacent Technology Legislation:** This class involves laws driven by concerns about national security, such as the CHIPS and Science Act. These bills often garner more bipartisan support and can move faster, especially when framed as competition with geopolitical rivals (e.g., China). The base rate for passage within a two-year session is higher, perhaps **30-40%**, but still requires significant consensus-building.
3.  **Legislation in the Final Two Months of a Congressional Year:** The period from November to December is typically dominated by "must-pass" legislation like appropriations bills and the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). Passing a standalone, complex new bill during this "lame duck" or end-of-session period is extremely rare. The base rate is likely **<5%** unless the legislation is attached as an amendment to a must-pass vehicle.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-10-20** Bipartisan AI working group releases a "final framework" but no legislative text. ↑ — Shows continued high-level interest and consensus-building, but the lack of a formal bill this late in the year is a major negative indicator.
*   **2025-10-05** A leading AI lab (e.g., Anthropic or Google) publishes a paper detailing significant vulnerabilities in securing frontier models against state-level actors. ↑ — Increases the perceived urgency and provides technical justification for legislative action, potentially accelerating timelines.
*   **2025-09-15** The White House AI Safety Institute, established by the 2023 Executive Order, issues its first major report highlighting inconsistent and inadequate cybersecurity practices across major AI labs. ↑ — Provides political cover and a factual basis for Congress to act, pressuring labs and lawmakers.
*   **2025-08-01** Congressional leadership announces that the fall legislative calendar will be focused almost exclusively on FY2026 appropriations and avoiding a government shutdown. ↓ — Signals that floor time for new, non-essential legislation will be virtually non-existent, making passage of a standalone AI bill highly improbable.
*   **2025-06-12** A widely discussed draft bill on AI safety, including cybersecurity provisions, stalls in a key Senate committee over liability and enforcement disagreements. ↓ — Demonstrates that even with bipartisan agreement on the *need* for regulation, the details remain highly contentious and a source of legislative gridlock.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Major AI Security Incident:** A publicly disclosed theft or catastrophic misuse of a powerful AI model would be a large driver (↑). This is the most likely catalyst to overcome legislative inertia and force emergency action, similar to how major data breaches spurred privacy regulations.
2.  **Legislative Calendar & Competing Priorities:** The extremely short timeline to the end of 2025 is the single largest obstacle. With Congress focused on budget battles and other deadlines, finding floor time for a complex new bill is a massive challenge. This is a large driver (↓).
3.  **Bipartisan Leadership Consensus (Schumer/Rounds):** Continued, active support from Senate leadership is a key prerequisite. If they decide to attach an AI security provision to a must-pass bill (like the NDAA or an omnibus spending bill), the probability increases significantly. This is a moderate driver (↑).
4.  **Industry Lobbying:** Tech companies and industry groups, while publicly supporting "responsible AI," may lobby to delay, weaken, or shape the legislation to be less burdensome. Disagreement among industry players could also slow the process. This is a moderate driver (↓).
5.  **Geopolitical Pressure:** Evidence of adversaries making rapid, unsafe progress in AI could frame the issue as a national security imperative, creating bipartisan urgency to secure U.S. assets. This is a moderate driver (↑).

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Unprecedented Pace of Capability Gains:** Unlike prior technologies, AI capabilities are advancing exponentially. This creates a sense of urgency among policymakers that was absent in slower-moving debates like data privacy.
*   **Proactive vs. Reactive Stance:** Much of the legislative discussion is attempting to be proactive—regulating risks *before* a catastrophe. This is unusual for the U.S. Congress, which typically acts reactively. This proactive stance is harder to motivate than reacting to a clear and present harm.
*   **High-Level Bipartisan Interest:** The topic has sustained, serious attention from key leaders like Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, which is not typical for many novel tech issues. This elevates it above the normal legislative fray.
*   **Executive Branch Priming:** President Biden's 2023 Executive Order on AI has already established a policy framework and federal definitions (e.g., via NIST), doing some of the pre-legislative work and setting a baseline for congressional action.
*   **Focus on "Powerful" Models:** The resolution's focus on "powerful" models, rather than all AI, could make legislation easier to pass. It narrows the scope, targeting a few key companies and reducing broad-based industry opposition.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a prior anchored to the base rate for major, novel tech legislation passing in a single Congress, perhaps around 15% (equivalent n≈10).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↓ large) The extremely short time remaining (<2 months) and a crowded legislative calendar focused on must-pass bills is the dominant piece of evidence.
    *   (↓ moderate) The fact that no bill has passed a committee, let alone a full chamber, by November 2025 is a very strong negative signal of legislative viability.
    *   (↑ small) Sustained bipartisan interest from leadership and ongoing expert warnings about risk provide a plausible, but narrow, path to passage (e.g., as a rider on an omnibus).
    *   (↑ small) The groundwork laid by the White House Executive Order slightly reduces the legislative lift required.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence overwhelmingly points downward. The posterior probability should be significantly lower than the prior, reflecting the immense practical difficulty of passing this specific type of legislation in the time remaining.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Public statements from Schumer/McConnell/Johnson/Jeffries explicitly mentioning AI security as a "must-pass" lame-duck priority.
    *   A draft of an AI security bill being formally attached to the NDAA or an omnibus appropriations bill.
    *   A major, undeniable AI security breach or misuse event that captures national headlines.
    *   A sudden, unified endorsement of a specific legislative text by major industry players (e.g., Google, Microsoft, OpenAI).
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Leadership press conferences that exclusively mention appropriations and other non-AI priorities.
    *   Congress adjourning for the year without taking up a relevant bill.
    *   A new CBO score for a draft bill showing high implementation costs, creating fiscal opposition.
    *   Prominent think tanks or civil liberties groups from both left and right raising strong objections to a compromise bill.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Definitional Ambiguity:** The resolution hinges on what constitutes a "powerful" model and what "requires" security measures. A weak law with loopholes or voluntary standards might pass but not meet the resolution criteria's spirit. The "stated intent" clause gives the judging panel significant discretion.
*   **Omnibus Surprise:** The most plausible path to "Yes" is a last-minute inclusion in a massive, must-pass bill. This could happen quickly and with little public debate, making it a high-uncertainty event to track.
*   **Watered-Down Legislation:** A bill could pass that is titled as an AI security law but is substantively weak, perhaps only mandating reports to a federal agency. This would create a difficult resolution judgment.
*   **Executive Action vs. Legislation:** Continued executive actions or agency rulemaking (e.g., by NIST or CISA) might be mistaken for legislation, but they do not count for resolution. The law must be passed by Congress.

**Final Research Summary:**
Despite significant high-level interest and growing urgency around AI safety, the practical realities of the U.S. legislative process make passage of a dedicated AI cybersecurity law by the end of 2025 highly unlikely. The extremely short timeline and a crowded congressional calendar are formidable obstacles that would likely require a major crisis to overcome.

To forecast the probability of the U.S. passing legislation that requires cybersecurity around AI models before 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

**Base Rate:**  
Given the nature of the legislation, we can consider two relevant reference classes:  
- **Major, Novel U.S. Tech Legislation:** Historically, such legislation has a low base rate of passage within a single congressional session, around 10-20%.  
- **National Security-Adjacent Technology Legislation:** This has a higher base rate, around 30-40%, due to the potential for bipartisan support when framed as a national security issue.

**Chosen Base Rate:**  
Given the context of AI cybersecurity being both a novel tech issue and a national security concern, a blended base rate of around 25% seems appropriate. This reflects the higher likelihood due to national security framing but acknowledges the challenges of novel tech legislation.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities:**  
- The legislation is novel and involves emerging technology, similar to past tech legislation.
- It has national security implications, which can drive bipartisan support.

**Differences:**  
- The timeline is extremely short, with less than two months remaining in 2025.
- There is significant legislative gridlock and competing priorities, such as appropriations and avoiding a government shutdown.

These differences suggest a lower probability than the base rate due to the time constraints and legislative focus on other priorities.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Key Evidence:**
- **Bipartisan AI working group framework (2025-10-20):** Shows interest but no legislative text, indicating low immediate legislative viability. (↓)
- **AI lab vulnerability report (2025-10-05):** Increases urgency but not enough to overcome legislative inertia. (↑ small)
- **White House AI Safety Institute report (2025-09-15):** Provides political cover but not a legislative catalyst. (↑ small)
- **Congressional focus on appropriations (2025-08-01):** Strongly indicates limited floor time for new legislation. (↓ large)
- **Stalled draft bill (2025-06-12):** Demonstrates legislative gridlock. (↓ moderate)

**Likelihood Ratios:**  
- The evidence overwhelmingly suggests a decrease in probability due to legislative gridlock and time constraints.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)

**Prior Probability:** 25%  
**Evidence Impact:**  
- The dominant evidence (short timeline, legislative focus elsewhere) significantly decreases the probability.
- Small positive signals (bipartisan interest, reports) provide minimal upward pressure.

**Posterior Probability Calculation:**  
Given the strong negative evidence, we adjust the prior downward significantly. A reasonable posterior probability might be around 10%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

**Overconfidence Check:**  
- Consider the possibility of a last-minute legislative push or attachment to a must-pass bill, which could increase the probability.
- A major AI security incident could rapidly change priorities.

**Alternative Forecast:**  
- A more optimistic forecast might consider a 15-20% probability if assuming a higher likelihood of last-minute legislative maneuvers.

**Rebuttals:**  
- The legislative calendar and focus on appropriations are strong counterarguments to a higher probability.

### 6. Final Forecast

Considering all factors, including the base rate, evidence, and potential for last-minute changes, the final calibrated probability is:

Final: 10%

# Will the U.S. pass legislation requiring cybersecurity around AI models before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to consider the base rate of major technology regulation passing in the United States, particularly within a limited timeframe.

The most appropriate reference class is **major, novel U.S. technology legislation with security implications**. Looking at historical examples:

- Comprehensive federal data privacy legislation has been debated for years without passage
- The CHIPS and Science Act took multiple years to pass, even with bipartisan support
- Cybersecurity legislation typically moves slowly unless attached to must-pass bills

Given that we're looking at legislation that must pass by December 31, 2025 (less than 2 months from the current date of November 1, 2025), and no bill has yet passed a committee, the base rate is extremely low.

**Prior probability: 10%** (odds of 1:9)

This reflects the historical difficulty of passing complex technology regulation in the U.S., especially with the short timeline remaining.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Requires bipartisan support in a likely divided Congress
- Involves complex technical issues requiring expert input
- Affects powerful industry players with lobbying influence
- Competes with other legislative priorities

**Key differences:**
- **Timeline pressure**: With less than 2 months remaining in 2025, this is far more constrained than typical legislative timelines
- **Executive groundwork**: Biden's 2023 Executive Order on AI has established some policy framework
- **Bipartisan interest**: Leaders like Schumer have shown sustained interest in AI regulation
- **National security framing**: AI security can be positioned as a national security issue, which typically garners more bipartisan support

The extremely short timeline is the most significant difference from the base case, strongly pushing the probability downward.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: No bill has passed committee by November 2025**
- P(E|H): If legislation will pass by year-end, what's the probability we'd see no bill through committee by November? Very low, perhaps 0.1
- P(E|~H): If legislation won't pass, what's the probability we'd see no bill through committee? Very high, perhaps 0.9
- Likelihood ratio: 0.1/0.9 = 0.11
- This strongly decreases the probability

**Evidence 2: Bipartisan AI working group released framework but no legislative text (Oct 20, 2025)**
- P(E|H): If legislation will pass, what's the probability we'd see only a framework this late? Moderate, perhaps 0.4
- P(E|~H): If legislation won't pass, what's the probability we'd see only a framework? High, perhaps 0.8
- Likelihood ratio: 0.4/0.8 = 0.5
- This moderately decreases the probability

**Evidence 3: Congressional leadership announced focus on appropriations (Aug 1, 2025)**
- P(E|H): If legislation will pass, what's the probability leadership would announce this focus? Low, perhaps 0.2
- P(E|~H): If legislation won't pass, what's the probability of this announcement? High, perhaps 0.9
- Likelihood ratio: 0.2/0.9 = 0.22
- This strongly decreases the probability

**Evidence 4: AI Safety Institute report highlighting inadequate cybersecurity (Sept 15, 2025)**
- P(E|H): If legislation will pass, what's the probability of such a report? High, perhaps 0.8
- P(E|~H): If legislation won't pass, what's the probability of such a report? Moderate, perhaps 0.5
- Likelihood ratio: 0.8/0.5 = 1.6
- This moderately increases the probability

**Evidence 5: Leading AI lab published paper on vulnerabilities (Oct 5, 2025)**
- P(E|H): If legislation will pass, what's the probability of such a paper? High, perhaps 0.7
- P(E|~H): If legislation won't pass, what's the probability of such a paper? Moderate, perhaps 0.4
- Likelihood ratio: 0.7/0.4 = 1.75
- This moderately increases the probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 1:9 (10% probability)

First update (Evidence 1: No bill through committee):
- Prior odds: 1:9
- Likelihood ratio: 0.11
- Posterior odds = 1:9 × 0.11 = 0.11:9 = 1:81.8
- Posterior probability = 1/(1+81.8) ≈ 1.2%

Second update (Evidence 2: Framework but no legislative text):
- Prior odds: 1:81.8
- Likelihood ratio: 0.5
- Posterior odds = 1:81.8 × 0.5 = 0.5:81.8 = 1:163.6
- Posterior probability = 1/(1+163.6) ≈ 0.6%

Third update (Evidence 3: Leadership focus on appropriations):
- Prior odds: 1:163.6
- Likelihood ratio: 0.22
- Posterior odds = 1:163.6 × 0.22 = 0.22:163.6 = 1:744.5
- Posterior probability = 1/(1+744.5) ≈ 0.13%

Fourth update (Evidence 4: AI Safety Institute report):
- Prior odds: 1:744.5
- Likelihood ratio: 1.6
- Posterior odds = 1:744.5 × 1.6 = 1.6:744.5 = 1:465.3
- Posterior probability = 1/(1+465.3) ≈ 0.21%

Fifth update (Evidence 5: AI lab vulnerability paper):
- Prior odds: 1:465.3
- Likelihood ratio: 1.75
- Posterior odds = 1:465.3 × 1.75 = 1.75:465.3 = 1:265.9
- Posterior probability = 1/(1+265.9) ≈ 0.37%

This extremely low probability reflects the overwhelming evidence against passage given the timeline constraints. However, I should consider whether I've been too aggressive in my updates.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- **Rider possibility**: AI cybersecurity provisions could be attached to must-pass legislation like the NDAA or omnibus spending bill, which is a common way for Congress to pass legislation quickly
- **Crisis response**: A major AI security incident could trigger emergency legislation
- **Overweighting timeline**: While the timeline is tight, Congress can move quickly when motivated
- **Underestimating bipartisan consensus**: AI security may have more behind-the-scenes agreement than public signals suggest

**Alternative forecast and rebuttals:**
- **Alternative (higher) forecast**: One could argue for 5-10% probability based on the possibility of a rider attachment to must-pass legislation
- **Rebuttal**: Even with a rider, the lack of committee-passed text by November makes drafting and negotiating such provisions extremely difficult

**Adjusting for overconfidence:**
My sequential Bayesian updates may have compounded to create an unrealistically low probability. The evidence against passage is strong, but not absolute. The most plausible path to passage would be as a rider on must-pass legislation, which happens with some regularity in Congress.

Given these considerations, I should adjust my forecast upward from the mechanistic 0.37% to account for these alternative pathways and my potential overconfidence.

## 6. Final Forecast

After considering the base rate, the specific evidence, and potential blind spots, I believe the probability of U.S. legislation requiring cybersecurity around AI models passing before 2026 is extremely low but not impossible.

The overwhelming factors against passage are:
1. The extremely short timeline (less than 2 months remaining)
2. No bill has passed committee by November 2025
3. Congressional leadership's announced focus on appropriations
4. The typical slow pace of complex technology legislation

The only plausible path to passage would be as a rider on must-pass legislation, which provides some non-zero probability.

Final: 3%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The most relevant base rate is the probability of a novel, complex, and non-essential piece of legislation passing in the final two months of a U.S. congressional session (the "lame duck" period). This period is typically reserved for "must-pass" legislation like government funding bills (appropriations) and the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). New, standalone initiatives face enormous procedural hurdles and competition for scarce floor time.

A generous base rate for such a bill passing in this specific, short timeframe is very low. The research report suggests **<5%**. I will anchor my prior to this, selecting an initial probability of **4%**. This acknowledges that while success is rare, it's not impossible, especially for topics with high-level interest.

Prior Odds: 4 / 96 = 1-to-24.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities:** Like any other new bill in a lame-duck session, this AI legislation is not a "must-pass" item in the same way a government funding bill is. It must compete for attention and legislative oxygen against these critical deadlines. It also involves complex technical and legal details that are difficult to negotiate and finalize under extreme time pressure.
*   **Differences:**
    *   **National Security Framing:** Unlike many tech policy debates (e.g., data privacy), AI security has a strong and growing national security dimension. This framing can generate bipartisan urgency and makes it a more plausible candidate for inclusion in a must-pass national security bill like the NDAA.
    *   **Leadership Interest:** The issue has sustained, high-level attention from key figures like Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. This is a significant difference from a typical bill and increases the chance that it will be prioritized for a last-minute legislative push.
    *   **Executive Branch Groundwork:** President Biden's 2023 Executive Order has already done some of the foundational policy work, which could slightly reduce the legislative lift required.

These differences suggest the bill has a somewhat higher chance than a random, novel bill in a lame-duck session, but the fundamental structural barriers remain.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will evaluate the key developments from the research report, which are dated from June to October 2025. The current date is November 1, 2025.

*   **Evidence 1 (Strongly Negative):** As of late October, a bipartisan group has released a "final framework" but **no legislative text**. The legislative process requires a formal bill. The absence of a bill this late in the year is a very strong signal that a law is not imminent.
    *   P(E | H): The probability of having no bill text by late October, *if* a law is to pass by December 31, is extremely low.
    *   P(E | ~H): The probability of having no bill text, *if* a law is *not* going to pass, is very high. This is a common outcome for congressional working groups.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Very low / Very high << 1. This evidence massively decreases the probability.

*   **Evidence 2 (Negative):** In August, leadership stated the fall calendar would focus on appropriations. In June, a draft bill stalled in committee.
    *   This evidence reinforces the base rate assumption. It shows that AI legislation is not currently on the "must-pass" track and that significant disagreements on the details persist.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** < 1. This evidence further decreases the probability.

*   **Evidence 3 (Slightly Positive):** Reports in September/October from the White House AI Safety Institute and a leading lab highlighted significant security vulnerabilities.
    *   This evidence provides a potential catalyst for action. It creates political pressure and a justification for leaders to force the issue, likely by attaching a provision to a larger bill.
    *   P(E | H): The probability of seeing such "crisis" reports, *if* a law is to pass, is high. They provide the necessary political fuel.
    *   P(E | ~H): The probability of seeing these reports, *if* no law passes, is also reasonably high, as these institutions would issue findings regardless.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** High / Reasonably High > 1. This evidence slightly increases the probability, as it makes the narrow path to passage more plausible.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)

Let's start with the prior odds of 1-to-24 (4%).

The most powerful piece of evidence is the lack of legislative text by late October and the crowded calendar. This is the primary obstacle. The likelihood ratio here is very small, perhaps 0.25, reflecting that this situation is four times more likely if the bill fails than if it passes.

*   **Step 1 Update:**
    *   Posterior Odds = Prior Odds × Likelihood Ratio
    *   Posterior Odds = (1-to-24) × 0.25 = 1-to-96.
    *   This corresponds to a probability of 1 / (1 + 96) ≈ **1%**.

Now, we incorporate the positive evidence: the "urgency" created by recent reports on vulnerabilities. This makes the most plausible "Yes" scenario—attaching the legislation to a must-pass bill—more likely. Let's assign this a likelihood ratio of 2.0, meaning this evidence makes passage twice as likely.

*   **Step 2 Update:**
    *   Posterior Odds = (1-to-96) × 2.0 = 1-to-48.
    *   This corresponds to a final probability of 1 / (1 + 48) ≈ **2.04%**.

The net effect of the evidence is a strong downward revision from the initial prior, as the procedural hurdles are immense and concrete, while the drivers for passage are more speculative.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My analysis concludes with a very low probability. What is the best argument for a higher forecast?

The primary counterargument is the "Omnibus Surprise" or "NDAA Rider" scenario. In this scenario, a deal has already been quietly negotiated by leadership, and the legislative text is being held back strategically to be inserted into a massive, must-pass bill at the last minute, bypassing the normal process. The public signals (crowded calendar, no text) would be misleading. Given the national security implications and Schumer's interest, this is a non-trivial possibility.

However, even this path is difficult. It requires consensus among the "four corners" of congressional leadership, and any single influential member can often object and derail such an addition. The fact that a bill stalled in committee over disagreements earlier in the year suggests that such a consensus may not exist.

While the "Omnibus Surprise" is the most plausible path to a "Yes," its probability is still low. My forecast of ~2% already implicitly accounts for this being the only realistic, albeit unlikely, way forward. A slightly higher forecast, perhaps 3-4%, might be justified if one believes a backroom deal is more likely than I have estimated. I will stick with my updated probability but acknowledge this as the main source of uncertainty. The ~2% figure feels like a good balance, representing a very unlikely but not impossible event. I will nudge it up slightly to 3% to better reflect the tail risk of a leadership-driven surprise.

### 6. Final Forecast

The base rate for passing a new, complex law in the final two months of a congressional session is extremely low. The overwhelming evidence—the lack of a formal bill by November 1st and a legislative calendar crowded with must-pass items—points strongly toward failure. The only plausible path to passage is a last-minute maneuver to attach the legislation to a larger vehicle like the NDAA or an omnibus spending bill. While the national security framing and leadership interest make this a non-zero possibility, it remains a significant longshot. The procedural obstacles are simply too high to overcome in the time remaining.

Final: 3%
