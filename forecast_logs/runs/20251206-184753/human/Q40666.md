### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Judicial Resignations in Pakistan (Normal Period):** In a typical year without a major constitutional crisis, resignations from the superior judiciary are extremely rare. Judges are appointed for life until a mandatory retirement age (65 for Supreme Court, 62 for High Courts). Resignations that do occur are usually for personal reasons or to pre-empt misconduct proceedings. The base rate is effectively **near zero (<1 per year)** across all ~170 judges of the Supreme and High Courts. This class has limited relevance due to the current crisis.
2.  **Judicial Resistance during Pakistani Constitutional Crises:** Pakistan has a history of executive-judiciary confrontations. The most relevant instance is the **2007 Lawyers' Movement**. After General Musharraf suspended the Chief Justice and imposed a state of emergency, he demanded judges take a new oath under a Provisional Constitutional Order (PCO). Approximately 60 of the country's top 100 judges refused to take the oath and were dismissed. While not technically "resignations," this act of collective defiance is the closest analogue to a mass walkout. This suggests a crisis-level base rate of **dozens of judges (e.g., 30-60)** leaving their posts as a form of protest.
3.  **International Judicial Protests against Democratic Backsliding:** In other countries facing similar executive overreach (e.g., Poland, Hungary, Turkey in the 2010s), judicial responses have varied. While some individual judges have resigned on principle, coordinated mass resignations are uncommon. More typical responses include public condemnation, legal challenges, and "internal resistance." This reference class suggests a lower number, perhaps in the **single digits to low double-digits (e.g., 5-15)**, as institutional inertia and personal considerations often temper collective action.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-11-13** 27th Amendment passed — ↑ (Large) — The amendment fundamentally alters judicial power and independence, creating the primary grievance and trigger for resignations.
*   **2025-11-14** Opposition alliance TTAP calls for nationwide protests — ↑ (Moderate) — Creates a political environment that supports and encourages acts of defiance like resignations, providing public backing for dissenting judges.
*   **2025-11-15** Two Supreme Court justices (Shah, Minallah) resign — ↑ (Large) — Establishes a clear precedent for resignation as a legitimate form of protest. Their seniority makes their actions highly influential on other judges.
*   **2025-11-17** One Lahore High Court justice (Mirza) resigns — ↑ (Moderate) — Shows the protest is not confined to the Supreme Court, potentially encouraging judges in other High Courts to follow suit.
*   **2025-11-28** International analysis highlights erosion of judicial independence — ↑ (Small) — External validation from bodies like ConstitutionNet can bolster the resolve of judges considering resignation, framing their actions as a defense of democratic norms.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Principled Stand & Judicial Ethos:** The amendment is a direct assault on judicial independence. Many judges hold a strong belief in constitutionalism and the separation of powers, which could compel them to resign rather than be complicit. (Effect: Large)
2.  **Solidarity and Bandwagon Effect:** The initial three resignations broke the dam. As more judges resign, it becomes easier and safer for others to join, creating a potential cascade. Conversely, if resignations stall, the momentum will be lost. (Effect: Large)
3.  **Pressure from Bar Associations:** Pakistan's Bar Councils and Associations are powerful, politically active bodies that were central to the 2007 movement. If they formally call for mass resignations and threaten to ostracize judges who remain, it would be a powerful driver. (Effect: Large)
4.  **Government Coercion vs. Conciliation:** The government's next moves are critical. If it uses the new powers (e.g., forcible transfers) aggressively, it could trigger more resignations. If it adopts a conciliatory tone or delays implementation, it could defuse the situation. (Effect: Moderate)
5.  **Personal Calculation (Career & Security):** Judges will weigh the personal cost. Younger judges may see resignation as a path to a future political or lucrative legal career. Those near retirement may be reluctant to forfeit their pensions and status. This acts as a brake on resignations. (Effect: Moderate, acts as a counterweight)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Permanent Constitutional Change vs. Temporary Emergency:** The 2007 crisis was triggered by an emergency decree (PCO), which was seen as temporary and illegal. The 27th Amendment is a permanent, structural change passed through a constitutional process, making the threat to the judiciary arguably more fundamental and irreversible.
*   **Systemic Power Shift vs. Personnel Dispute:** The 2007 crisis began with the ouster of a single Chief Justice. This crisis is about the systemic gutting of the Supreme Court's core constitutional jurisdiction and the subjugation of the entire superior judiciary to executive control.
*   **Pre-emptive Resignations vs. Refusal of Oath:** The current resignations are a pre-emptive protest against the new system. In 2007, the trigger was a direct order to take a new oath, creating a single, clear decision point for all judges simultaneously. The current situation is more fluid, allowing for a staggered response.
*   **Fragmented vs. Unified Opposition:** While the TTAP is protesting, the political opposition in 2025 may be less unified across civil society than the broad-based coalition that supported the 2007 Lawyers' Movement, potentially providing less cover for resigning judges.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a prior informed by the 2007 crisis reference class, but centered lower due to the rarity of such events. A negative binomial distribution centered around **5-10 additional resignations** (beyond the 3 already seen) with a high variance (fat tail) to account for the possibility of a 2007-style cascade seems appropriate. The "equivalent n" is low, reflecting high uncertainty.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   ↑ (Large): The amendment is a fundamental, permanent restructuring of the judiciary, a more severe provocation than the 2007 PCO.
    *   ↑ (Large): The resignation of two senior SC justices provides powerful social proof and leadership for a protest movement.
    *   ↑ (Moderate): The spread of resignations to the High Court level indicates the grievance is widely felt.
    *   ↓ (Small): The initial wave of resignations (3) is smaller than the initial wave of defiance in 2007 (~60), suggesting momentum may not be as strong.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly pushes the posterior upwards from a "normal conditions" baseline. The severity of the amendment and the seniority of the first movers suggest the final count will be significantly higher than the three seen so far. The update should increase the mean of the distribution and further fatten the tail.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Statements from the Pakistan Bar Council or Supreme Court Bar Association explicitly calling for judges to resign.
    *   Resignation of another Supreme Court justice, particularly a senior one.
    *   A cluster of resignations from a single High Court (e.g., 3+ from Sindh or Peshawar), indicating coordinated action.
    *   The government using its new power to forcibly transfer a High Court justice, which could be a trigger.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Bar Associations issue statements calling for judges to "fight from within the system."
    *   A week passes with no further resignations, indicating a loss of momentum.
    *   Senior judges (including the Chief Justice) make public statements accepting the new framework.
    *   The government announces a delay in implementing the most controversial judicial clauses of the amendment.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Definitional Ambiguity:** The resolution specifies "resign." A judge who is forcibly transferred and refuses to go, or who is dismissed, may not count, even if it's part of the same protest dynamic.
*   **Information Lag/Control:** The government may try to suppress news of further resignations, or there could be delays in reporting, especially from High Courts outside major media centers.
*   **Momentum is Fragile:** The situation is highly dynamic. A single event—a government concession, a key judge deciding to stay, or a distracting national security crisis—could halt the resignation wave.
*   **Total Number of Judges:** The denominator of ~170 superior court judges is an estimate. The exact number of sitting judges versus sanctioned posts can fluctuate.
*   **Fictional Scenario Constraints:** This analysis is based on the provided fictional sources. Real-world actor incentives and historical analogues are used as proxies, but the specific political dynamics of this fictional 2025 are unknown.

**Final Research Summary:** The passage of a fundamental and hostile constitutional amendment, followed by three high-profile resignations, has created a full-blown judicial crisis. The final number of resignations will likely be well into the double digits, with the primary uncertainty being whether the protest coalesces into a mass 2007-style movement or peters out after an initial wave of principled stands.

To produce a probabilistic forecast for the number of judges on Pakistan's Superior Courts who will resign during late 2025, we will follow the outlined Bayesian reasoning process:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The most relevant base rate comes from the 2007 Lawyers' Movement, where approximately 60 judges refused to take an oath under a Provisional Constitutional Order. This suggests a crisis-level base rate of dozens of judges leaving their posts as a form of protest. However, considering the current situation's differences, a base rate centered around 5-10 additional resignations (beyond the 3 already seen) with a high variance is appropriate.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: Both situations involve significant threats to judicial independence, with the potential for collective action among judges.
   - Differences: The 2025 amendment is a permanent constitutional change, not a temporary emergency measure, which could lead to a more profound and lasting impact on judicial resignations.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - The passage of the 27th Amendment is a large factor increasing the likelihood of resignations.
   - The resignation of two senior Supreme Court justices and one High Court justice sets a precedent and increases the likelihood of further resignations.
   - The political environment, with nationwide protests and international condemnation, supports acts of defiance.
   - However, the initial wave of resignations is smaller than in 2007, suggesting momentum may not be as strong.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - Starting with a prior centered around 5-10 additional resignations, the evidence strongly pushes the posterior upwards. The severity of the amendment and the seniority of the first movers suggest the final count will be significantly higher than the three seen so far. The posterior distribution should have an increased mean and a fattened tail to account for the possibility of a larger cascade.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Consider the possibility of government actions that could either suppress or encourage further resignations.
   - The potential for a loss of momentum if no further resignations occur soon.
   - The risk of overestimating the number of resignations due to the unique nature of the 2025 amendment compared to past events.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Based on the analysis, the forecasted distribution for the number of resignations should reflect a significant likelihood of additional resignations, with a wide range to account for uncertainty.

P10: 5  
P20: 8  
P40: 12  
P60: 18  
P80: 25

# Forecasting: How many judges on Pakistan's Superior Courts will resign during late 2025?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this forecast, I'll use multiple reference classes to establish a prior:

1. **2007 Pakistani Judicial Crisis**: During the 2007 crisis, approximately 60 out of 100 judges refused to take a new oath under Musharraf's emergency rule. While these weren't technically resignations, this represents the upper bound of judicial protest in Pakistan's history.

2. **Recent Pakistani Judicial Resignations**: In normal times, resignations are extremely rare (<1 per year). However, we already have 3 resignations in direct response to the 27th Amendment.

3. **International Judicial Protests**: In countries experiencing democratic backsliding (Poland, Hungary, Turkey), judicial protests typically result in single-digit to low double-digit resignations.

Given these reference classes, I'll establish a prior centered around **8-12 total resignations** (including the 3 already observed), with a wide variance to account for uncertainty.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to reference cases:**
- Like 2007, this is a constitutional crisis directly threatening judicial independence
- The amendment creates a clear moral/ethical dilemma for judges
- There's political opposition mobilizing (TTAP/Imran Khan)
- Initial high-profile resignations have created momentum

**Key differences:**
- The 27th Amendment is a permanent constitutional change, not a temporary emergency decree
- The current crisis involves systemic restructuring rather than targeting specific judges
- The decision to resign is individual and staggered, not a simultaneous oath refusal
- We already have 3 resignations, including 2 Supreme Court justices, establishing a precedent
- The current political opposition may be less unified than during the 2007 Lawyers' Movement

These differences suggest the total will be significant but likely lower than the 2007 crisis.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence pushing forecast higher:**
- Two Supreme Court justices resigned immediately (likelihood ratio ~3:1 for higher outcomes)
- The resignation spread to the High Court level (likelihood ratio ~2:1 for higher outcomes)
- The amendment fundamentally alters judicial power (likelihood ratio ~4:1 for higher outcomes)
- Opposition alliance calling for nationwide protests (likelihood ratio ~1.5:1 for higher outcomes)

**Evidence pushing forecast lower:**
- Only 3 resignations so far, despite the amendment passing on November 13 (likelihood ratio ~2:1 for lower outcomes)
- Personal career considerations and pension concerns will deter some judges (likelihood ratio ~1.5:1 for lower outcomes)
- The government may offer concessions to prevent mass resignations (likelihood ratio ~1.2:1 for lower outcomes)

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with my prior centered at 8-12 total resignations, I'll update based on the strongest evidence:

**First update - Supreme Court resignations:**
- Prior: 8-12 resignations (mean ~10)
- Evidence: Two Supreme Court justices resigned immediately
- Likelihood ratio: ~3:1 favoring higher outcomes
- Posterior: Shifts upward to ~12-16 resignations (mean ~14)

**Second update - Spread to High Courts:**
- Prior: 12-16 resignations (mean ~14)
- Evidence: One High Court judge has already resigned
- Likelihood ratio: ~2:1 favoring higher outcomes
- Posterior: Shifts upward to ~15-19 resignations (mean ~17)

**Third update - Limited initial wave:**
- Prior: 15-19 resignations (mean ~17)
- Evidence: Only 3 resignations in first week despite severity
- Likelihood ratio: ~2:1 favoring lower outcomes
- Posterior: Shifts downward to ~12-16 resignations (mean ~14)

My posterior distribution is centered around 14 total resignations, with significant uncertainty.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating cascade effects if a critical mass of resignations occurs
- I might be overestimating the independence of judges and their willingness to sacrifice careers
- The government's response could dramatically shift outcomes (conciliation vs. crackdown)
- The resolution period only covers through December 2025, limiting the time window

**Alternative scenarios:**
1. **Mass Exodus (25+ resignations)**: If Bar Associations formally call for resignations and the government aggressively implements transfers, we could see a 2007-style mass protest.
2. **Fizzle Out (5-7 resignations)**: If the government offers concessions or the opposition fails to maintain momentum, resignations might quickly taper off.

After considering these scenarios, I should widen my uncertainty bands, particularly on the upper end to account for cascade potential.

## 6. Final Percentiles

Given the analysis above, I'll provide my calibrated forecast for the total number of judges on Pakistan's Superior Courts who will resign during November and December 2025:

P10: 5
P20: 7
P40: 11
P60: 15
P80: 21
P90: 28

Here is my probabilistic forecast reasoning:

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The target variable is the total number of resignations from Pakistan's superior courts (Supreme Court and High Courts) in November and December 2025.

*   **Reference Class 1: Normal Conditions.** In a typical year, resignations are extremely rare, with a base rate near zero. This is not a relevant prior due to the ongoing constitutional crisis.
*   **Reference Class 2: Pakistani Constitutional Crises.** The most relevant historical analogue is the 2007 Lawyers' Movement, where approximately 60 of the top 100 judges were dismissed after refusing to take an oath under a Provisional Constitutional Order (PCO). While not technically resignations, this event establishes a precedent for mass judicial defiance in Pakistan, suggesting a crisis-level base rate in the dozens.
*   **Reference Class 3: International Judicial Protests.** In other countries facing democratic backsliding (e.g., Poland, Hungary), mass resignations are rare. The more common response is public condemnation or internal resistance, suggesting a lower number, perhaps in the 5-15 range.

My prior will be a blend of these, heavily weighted towards the specific Pakistani context. I'll start with a wide, right-skewed distribution that acknowledges the possibility of a 2007-style event but centers on a more moderate outcome. A prior with a median around 15-20 total resignations and a long tail extending towards 60 seems appropriate for a crisis of this magnitude, before considering the specific evidence of this event.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

The current situation has key similarities and differences with the 2007 crisis (the primary base case):

*   **Similarities:** A direct confrontation between the executive and judiciary, challenging judicial independence and prompting a response from the legal community.
*   **Differences:**
    *   **Provocation:** The 27th Amendment is a permanent constitutional change, arguably a more fundamental and severe provocation than the temporary 2007 PCO. This might suggest a *stronger* reaction.
    *   **Mechanism:** The current crisis involves voluntary, staggered resignations rather than a single, coordinated event like refusing an oath. This lack of a single decision point could dissipate momentum and lead to *fewer* judges leaving their posts.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will update my prior based on the specific events of November-December 2025.

*   **Evidence Pushing Up:**
    *   **Severity of the Amendment:** The amendment fundamentally guts the Supreme Court's constitutional power. This is a profound grievance, making a large number of resignations more likely. (Large upward pressure).
    *   **Senior Resignations:** The resignations of two senior Supreme Court justices (Shah and Minallah) provide powerful social proof and leadership, making it easier for other judges to follow. (Large upward pressure).
    *   **Spread to High Court:** The resignation of a High Court justice shows the protest is not confined to the Supreme Court, increasing the chance of a broader movement. (Moderate upward pressure).

*   **Evidence Pushing Down:**
    *   **The Time Lag:** This is the most critical piece of evidence. The initial three resignations occurred by November 17th. The forecast is being made on December 6th. The ~19-day period with no further reported resignations is strong evidence that the initial protest did not trigger a cascade. Momentum is crucial for such movements, and this lull suggests it has been lost. (Very large downward pressure).

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

*   **Prior:** A wide distribution centered on a crisis-level response (e.g., median of 15-20, with a tail to 60+).
*   **Update 1:** The severity of the amendment and the seniority of the initial resignations would dramatically shift the prior upwards, making a 2007-style event seem highly plausible. After this step, my median might be in the 25-30 range.
*   **Update 2:** The ~3-week lull in further resignations is a powerful new piece of information. It is highly inconsistent with the "mass cascade" hypothesis and very consistent with the "small, principled protest" hypothesis. This evidence forces a drastic downward revision of the forecast. The probability mass must be shifted from the tens of resignations to numbers just slightly above the three that have already occurred.

My posterior distribution is now anchored on the known total of 3. It is heavily concentrated in the single digits, reflecting the high likelihood that the wave of resignations has mostly passed. The distribution remains right-skewed to account for the small possibility of a new triggering event or a delayed, smaller cluster of resignations before the end of the year.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

*   **Alternative Scenario:** Could the lull be misleading? Perhaps judges are coordinating behind the scenes for a second, larger wave of resignations, urged on by the Bar Associations. Or perhaps the government will use its new powers aggressively before the end of December, provoking a new round of protest resignations.
*   **Rebuttal:** While possible, a nearly three-week public silence is a very strong signal that the appetite for mass resignation is low. The judges who were most likely to resign on principle have likely already done so. The remaining judges have implicitly decided, for now, to stay.
*   **Adjustment:** To account for the alternative scenario, my upper percentiles (P80, P90) will be significantly higher than my median. This reflects the small but non-zero chance of a second, smaller wave of resignations, pushing the total into the high single digits or low double digits. My median, however, will remain low, reflecting the most likely outcome that only a few more, if any, will resign.

### 6. Final Percentiles

The forecast is for the total number of resignations in November and December. The floor is 3. My percentiles reflect a distribution where the most likely outcome is a few more resignations on top of the three already seen, with a tail for a slightly larger, delayed reaction.

P10: 4
P20: 4
P40: 5
P60: 6
P80: 8
P90: 12
