### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Major Across-the-Board Congressional Tariff Increases:** This is the most specific reference class. Historically, Congress ceding tariff power to the executive has been the norm since the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934. The last time Congress passed a truly sweeping, protectionist, across-the-board tariff bill was the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930. This suggests such an event is exceptionally rare, occurring perhaps once a century.
    *   **Base rate:** <1% in any given year.
    *   **Limitations:** The political and economic context is vastly different. The Republican party's platform has shifted significantly on trade, and the globalized nature of the modern economy creates different pressures.

2.  **Major Partisan Economic Legislation in a Unified Government:** A broader class is the passage of a president's signature, but controversial, economic policy in the first year of a new term with their party controlling Congress (e.g., ACA in 2009-10, Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in 2017). This happens with some regularity.
    *   **Base rate:** 20-30% chance of at least one such bill passing in the first year of a unified government.
    *   **Limitations:** This class is too broad. Tariff policy is unique due to its foreign policy implications, direct impact on consumer prices, and the specific legislative tools available (e.g., reconciliation, presidential authorities). The "across-the-board" nature of the proposed bill is far more ambitious than most partisan economic bills.

3.  **Congressional Action to Codify or Bolster Executive Action:** A president takes a legally contestable action via Executive Order (EO), and Congress later passes legislation to give it a firmer legal foundation. This is a plausible scenario, for instance, in national security or immigration policy.
    *   **Base rate:** 5-10% in a given year where a major, legally dubious EO is in effect.
    *   **Limitations:** This is highly dependent on the perceived legal vulnerability of the EO and the political will to engage in a difficult legislative fight when the policy is already de facto in place.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-10-24** CTV News details ongoing US-Canada trade war. (↓) The conflict is being managed via executive tariffs, exemptions, and retaliatory measures, suggesting the executive track is the primary and sufficient tool for the administration, reducing the need for a new bill.
*   **2025-10-21** Ballotpedia notes Trump has signed 210 EOs in his second term. (↓) This demonstrates a strong preference for unilateral executive action over the slower, more compromised legislative process, making a push for a Congressional bill less likely.
*   **2025-09-05** Holland & Knight tracker summarizes tariff EOs. (↓) The existence and ongoing amendment of tariff EOs confirms the administration is already implementing its policy without Congress. A bill would be redundant unless the EOs face a mortal legal threat.
*   **Hypothetical [2025-10-15]** A federal appeals court agrees to hear an expedited challenge to the legality of the administration's broad tariff EOs, citing potential overreach of presidential authority under the Trade Expansion Act. (↑) This is the most significant potential driver for a "Yes" resolution. A credible legal threat is the primary reason the White House would expend political capital on a difficult legislative fight.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **Legal Challenges to Executive Authority:** (Large ↑) If federal courts rule against or appear poised to rule against the legality of Trump's tariff EOs, the administration would be highly motivated to seek a legislative solution to preserve its signature policy. This is the primary driver for a "Yes" outcome.
*   **Senate Filibuster and GOP Cohesion:** (Large ↓) Passing such a controversial bill would almost certainly require 60 votes to overcome a Democratic filibuster in the Senate. This is a near-insurmountable hurdle. Even using budget reconciliation would require near-unanimous support from a likely narrow GOP majority, which is doubtful given the party's remaining free-trade wing.
*   **Sufficiency of Executive Action:** (Moderate ↓) As long as the EOs remain in effect and are achieving the administration's goals, there is little incentive to pursue a costly and uncertain legislative battle. The policy is already "on the books" via other means.
*   **Economic Blowback and Lobbying:** (Moderate ↓) By late 2025, the inflationary effects of the tariffs and retaliatory actions from trading partners would be clear. This would generate immense pressure from business groups, agricultural interests, and consumer advocates on moderate members of Congress to oppose any bill that makes the tariffs permanent.
*   **Legislative Calendar:** (Small ↓) With only two months left in 2025, the window to introduce, debate, and pass major, controversial legislation through both chambers is extremely narrow.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Presidential Preference for Tariffs:** Unlike most post-WWII presidents who favored trade liberalization, President Trump has a deep and consistent preference for protectionist tariffs, making the *attempt* more likely than the base rate suggests.
*   **Existing Unilateral Action:** The key difference is that the tariff policy is already being implemented via EO. The question is not "Will there be tariffs?" but "Will Congress codify them?" This makes the situation a test of legal necessity, not initial policy implementation.
*   **Divided Republican Party on Trade:** Unlike the more ideologically cohesive parties of the Smoot-Hawley era, the modern GOP is fractured on trade. A significant and powerful bloc of traditional free-trade Republicans remains, especially in the Senate, making party-line votes on tariffs difficult.
*   **Modern Legal/Treaty Framework:** The existence of the WTO and specific free trade agreements like USMCA creates a complex web of legal obligations and dispute-resolution mechanisms that did not exist in the early 20th century, complicating any broad legislative action.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a prior anchored to the reference class of major Congressional tariff hikes (<1%) but adjusted slightly upward for the unique political environment, suggesting a plausible prior of **~3%** (equivalent n≈30).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↓ Large) The administration has already implemented its policy via a flurry of Executive Orders, indicating a preference for unilateralism and reducing the immediate need for legislation.
    *   (↓ Large) The procedural hurdles in the Senate (filibuster) and the internal divisions within the Republican party on trade present a formidable barrier to passage.
    *   (↓ Moderate) The short legislative calendar and mounting economic blowback from existing tariffs make a difficult vote even less appealing for members of Congress.
    *   (↑ Moderate) The primary upward pressure is the *potential* for a successful court challenge to the EOs, which could force the administration's hand.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly reinforces the low prior. The existing EOs and high legislative barriers are powerful, concrete negatives, while the main positive driver (a court defeat) is still hypothetical. The posterior should move down from the initial prior.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   A significant federal court ruling (e.g., Circuit Court or Supreme Court) that blocks or limits Trump's tariff authority.
    *   Public statements from the Speaker of the House or Senate Majority Leader endorsing a legislative path for tariffs.
    *   The White House begins actively whipping votes or includes tariff legislation in a "must-pass" vehicle like a government funding bill.
    *   Trump explicitly calls on Congress to pass a tariff bill in a speech or on social media.

*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   The Supreme Court declines to hear a case challenging the tariff EOs, or a lower court rules in the administration's favor.
    *   Prominent free-trade Republicans (e.g., Senate Finance Committee members) publicly state their opposition to a broad tariff bill.
    *   The administration issues new EOs to tweak or amend the existing tariff regime, reinforcing its reliance on executive power.
    *   News reports focus on the negative economic impact of tariffs (e.g., inflation, job losses in specific sectors) ahead of the holiday season.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Resolution Specificity:** The bill must be "across-the-board" on "nearly all imports from all countries" (with a 10-country exception). A bill that only targets China or is otherwise limited in scope would resolve as "No".
*   **Definition of "Passed":** The bill must pass both the House and the Senate in 2025. A bill passing only one chamber is insufficient. Presidential signature is not explicitly required by the criteria, but is implied by "implements".
*   **"Black Swan" Event:** A major international crisis or conflict could be used to justify and fast-track emergency economic measures, including a broad tariff bill, bypassing normal political obstacles.
*   **Lame-Duck Session Shenanigans:** The end of a legislative year can produce unexpected outcomes. A tariff bill could be attached to a must-pass omnibus spending bill, forcing a difficult vote.

To forecast the probability of the US Congress passing a bill implementing Trump's tariff policies in 2025, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Base Rate:** The most relevant reference class is "Major Across-the-Board Congressional Tariff Increases," which historically is extremely rare, with a base rate of <1% in any given year. However, considering the unique political environment with Trump's presidency and the Republican control, we adjust this slightly upward to a plausible prior of **~3%**.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** The current situation involves a president with a strong preference for tariffs, similar to historical protectionist periods.
- **Differences:** Unlike the past, the modern GOP is divided on trade, and the global economic and legal frameworks (WTO, USMCA) are more complex, making broad tariff legislation more challenging.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Executive Orders (EOs):** The administration's reliance on EOs to implement tariffs suggests a preference for unilateral action, decreasing the likelihood of seeking Congressional approval. (Likelihood ratio: Large ↓)
- **Senate Filibuster and GOP Cohesion:** The need for 60 votes in the Senate and internal GOP divisions present significant barriers. (Likelihood ratio: Large ↓)
- **Legal Challenges:** A credible legal threat to the EOs could force legislative action, but this remains hypothetical. (Likelihood ratio: Moderate ↑)
- **Economic Blowback:** Negative economic impacts from tariffs could deter Congressional action. (Likelihood ratio: Moderate ↓)

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
- **Prior Odds:** 3% translates to odds of 0.03 / 0.97 ≈ 0.031.
- **Likelihood Ratios:** The evidence strongly supports a decrease in probability due to the reliance on EOs and legislative barriers.
- **Posterior Odds:** Adjusting for the evidence, the posterior odds decrease significantly.
- **Posterior Probability:** The updated probability is lower than the prior, reflecting the strong negative evidence.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the possibility of a "Black Swan" event or a strategic legislative maneuver (e.g., attaching tariffs to a must-pass bill).
- **Alternative Forecast:** A scenario where a court ruling invalidates the EOs could increase the probability, but this remains speculative.
- **Adjustment:** Given the strong negative evidence and the speculative nature of positive drivers, the probability remains low.

### 6. Final Forecast
- **Final Probability:** Considering the base rate, evidence, and potential scenarios, the probability of Congress passing such a bill in 2025 is very low.

Final: 2%

# Will the US Congress pass a bill implementing Trump's tariff policies in 2025?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to identify an appropriate base rate for Congress passing a bill implementing Trump's tariff policies in 2025.

The most relevant reference class is "Congressional passage of major tariff legislation in the modern era." Looking at history:
- The last major across-the-board tariff legislation was the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930
- Since the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934, Congress has largely delegated tariff authority to the executive branch
- In recent decades, Congress has focused more on trade agreements than broad tariff legislation

Given this historical pattern, the base rate for Congress passing sweeping tariff legislation in any given year is extremely low, approximately 1-2%.

However, I should adjust this slightly given the unique circumstances:
- Trump has explicitly campaigned on tariffs
- Republicans control both chambers of Congress
- There is increased protectionist sentiment in the Republican party

Taking these factors into account, I'll set a prior of **5%**.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Congress still faces the same institutional hurdles to passing major legislation
- Tariffs remain economically controversial with significant opposition from business interests
- The executive branch already has substantial tariff authority

**Key differences:**
- Trump has made tariffs a centerpiece of his economic agenda, unlike most modern presidents
- Trump has already begun implementing tariffs via executive order
- The Republican party has shifted significantly toward economic nationalism
- The global trade environment is more regulated (WTO, free trade agreements) than in previous eras

These differences suggest some upward pressure on the base rate, but the most critical factor is that Trump can already implement much of his tariff agenda through executive action, reducing the necessity for legislation.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Trump is already implementing tariffs via Executive Orders**
- P(E|H): If Congress will pass a tariff bill, it's still quite likely (~80%) Trump would use EOs in the meantime
- P(E|~H): If Congress won't pass a tariff bill, it's very likely (~95%) Trump would rely on EOs
- Likelihood ratio: 0.84 (evidence slightly decreases probability)

**Evidence 2: Procedural hurdles in Congress**
- P(E|H): If Congress will pass a tariff bill, we'd expect fewer procedural obstacles (~30%)
- P(E|~H): If Congress won't pass a bill, we'd expect significant procedural obstacles (~90%)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.33 (evidence significantly decreases probability)

**Evidence 3: Potential legal challenges to executive tariff authority**
- P(E|H): If Congress will pass a bill, we'd expect serious legal challenges to EOs (~80%)
- P(E|~H): If Congress won't pass a bill, we'd expect fewer successful legal challenges (~40%)
- Likelihood ratio: 2.0 (evidence increases probability)

**Evidence 4: Limited time remaining in 2025**
- P(E|H): If Congress will pass a bill, we'd expect more time available (~70%)
- P(E|~H): If Congress won't pass a bill, limited time is one reason why (~90%)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.78 (evidence moderately decreases probability)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior of 5% (odds of 1:19), I'll update based on the strongest evidence first:

**Update on procedural hurdles:**
- Prior odds: 1:19 (5%)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.33
- Posterior odds: 0.33:19 = 1:57.6
- Posterior probability: 1/(1+57.6) = 1.7%

**Update on legal challenges:**
- Prior odds: 1:57.6 (1.7%)
- Likelihood ratio: 2.0
- Posterior odds: 2:57.6 = 1:28.8
- Posterior probability: 1/(1+28.8) = 3.4%

**Update on limited time:**
- Prior odds: 1:28.8 (3.4%)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.78
- Posterior odds: 0.78:28.8 = 1:36.9
- Posterior probability: 1/(1+36.9) = 2.6%

**Update on existing EOs:**
- Prior odds: 1:36.9 (2.6%)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.84
- Posterior odds: 0.84:36.9 = 1:43.9
- Posterior probability: 1/(1+43.9) = 2.2%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the possibility of a major court ruling against Trump's tariff authority, which would create urgent pressure for legislation
- I haven't fully accounted for the possibility of tariff legislation being attached to must-pass bills in a lame-duck session
- I might be overestimating the cohesion of Republican opposition to tariffs given Trump's influence over the party

**Alternative scenarios:**
- A scenario where the Supreme Court expedites a case challenging Trump's tariff authority and rules against him by mid-2025 could significantly increase the probability
- If economic conditions deteriorate dramatically, Congress might pass emergency economic legislation that includes tariff provisions
- A national security crisis could prompt emergency economic measures including tariffs

**Adjustments:**
Given these considerations, I should slightly increase my probability to account for these tail risks. The most significant is the possibility of a court ruling against Trump's tariff authority, which would create a strong incentive for legislation.

Adjusting from 2.2% to 3%.

## 6. Final Forecast

After considering the historical base rate, the unique circumstances of Trump's presidency, the evidence of existing executive orders, procedural hurdles in Congress, potential legal challenges, and the limited time remaining in 2025, I arrive at a final forecast of 3%.

This reflects the significant obstacles to passing such legislation, particularly given that Trump can already implement much of his tariff agenda through executive action, but acknowledges the small possibility that legal challenges or other factors could necessitate congressional action.

Final: 3%

Here is a probabilistic forecast following the specified methodology.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most appropriate reference class is major, controversial, partisan economic legislation passed by Congress in a year with a unified government. A broader view of this class (e.g., the Affordable Care Act in 2009-10, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in 2017) suggests this happens with some regularity. However, a sweeping, across-the-board protectionist tariff bill is a much rarer event, with the last major example being the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930.

A blended approach is best. The modern political context, with a president highly focused on tariffs and a party more amenable to protectionism than in the past, suggests a higher base rate than the near-zero frequency of Smoot-Hawley-type bills. However, the unique contentiousness of trade policy and significant internal party divisions suggest a lower rate than for a more standard partisan priority like tax cuts.

Therefore, at the beginning of 2025, a reasonable prior probability for such a bill passing within the year would be around **5%**. This acknowledges the president's intent while respecting the high historical and procedural barriers. In odds, this is 1:19.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation differs from the base case of a unified government pursuing a legislative priority in several crucial ways:

*   **Executive Action Precedence:** The Trump administration has already implemented its tariff policy via a series of Executive Orders (EOs) throughout 2025. This means the policy is already in effect. The legislative question is not about *initiating* the policy, but about *codifying* or legally reinforcing a fait accompli. This reduces the urgency for legislative action unless the EOs face a credible legal threat.
*   **Timeline:** The current date is October 25, 2025. With only about two months left in the calendar year, the window for passing major, controversial legislation through both chambers of Congress is extremely narrow. Most of the time available to pass such a bill has already elapsed without success.
*   **Internal Party Division:** Unlike issues like tax cuts where the Republican party has broad consensus, trade is a deeply divisive issue. A significant free-trade wing of the party, particularly in the Senate, creates a major obstacle to achieving the near-perfect unity required to pass such a bill, especially if using a process like budget reconciliation.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
Let H be the event that Congress passes the specified tariff bill in 2025.

*   **Evidence 1: The administration has heavily relied on Executive Orders to implement tariffs.**
    *   P(E | H): This is low. If the primary strategy was a legislative one, such extensive and sustained unilateral action would be less likely. A bill would be pursued from the start.
    *   P(E | ~H): This is high. If a legislative path is blocked or not preferred, EOs are the only available tool.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** P(E|H)/P(E|~H) is much less than 1. This evidence strongly **decreases** the probability.

*   **Evidence 2: It is late October 2025, and no such bill has passed either chamber.**
    *   P(E | H): This is very low. For a bill to pass by year's end, it would almost certainly have to be well along in the legislative process by now.
    *   P(E | ~H): This is very high. If a bill is not going to pass, it is overwhelmingly likely that it would not have passed by late October.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Very small (<< 1). This evidence very strongly **decreases** the probability.

*   **Evidence 3: The provided research materials do not mention a major court ruling striking down or threatening the tariff EOs.**
    *   P(E | H): This is low. The most powerful catalyst for a difficult legislative push would be a legal defeat of the EOs. The absence of this catalyst makes a congressional effort less necessary and thus less likely.
    *   P(E | ~H): This is high. If the EOs are legally secure (or unchallenged), there is no need for Congress to act, so it is likely they will not.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Less than 1. This evidence **decreases** the probability.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Starting with a 5% prior (1:19 odds) at the beginning of the year, we update with the accumulated evidence.

1.  **Initial Prior:** 5% (Odds: 1:19)
2.  **Update for reliance on EOs & lack of legal threat:** This evidence strongly suggests the executive track is the chosen and viable path. This might reduce the odds by a factor of 4 (a conservative estimate), leading to new odds of 1:76, or a probability of ~1.3%.
3.  **Update for the late timeline (Oct 25):** This is the most powerful evidence. The chance of passing such a bill in the last two months, given it failed in the first ten, is very small. This should reduce the odds further, perhaps by another factor of 4.
    *   Posterior Odds = (1:76) × (1/4) = 1:304
    *   Posterior Probability = 1 / (1 + 304) ≈ 0.3%

This rough calculation shows that the evidence pushes the probability to a very low number, well under 1%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
The primary argument for a "Yes" outcome, despite the evidence, is a chaotic end-of-year legislative session. A tariff bill could be attached as a rider to a "must-pass" omnibus spending bill, forcing a difficult vote under threat of a government shutdown. This is a low-probability but non-zero scenario that depends on the President making it an absolute, non-negotiable demand and Congressional leadership complying.

The Manifold market forecast of 6.2% is significantly higher than my analysis suggests. This could be due to market inertia or a higher weight placed on the unpredictability of the Trump administration and year-end legislative dynamics. While my analysis points to a sub-1% chance, the market's position suggests I should be cautious about being overconfident in such a low number. The "lame-duck surprise" scenario could plausibly have a 1-2% chance on its own.

Therefore, I will adjust my final forecast slightly upward from the sub-1% calculated in the update to account for this tail risk. A probability of 2% reflects a very unlikely event that still has a plausible, albeit narrow, path to occurring.

### 6. Final Forecast
The initial 5% prior is strongly diminished by the evidence from the first ten months of 2025. The administration's clear preference for using executive orders, the lack of a legal challenge forcing a legislative solution, and the extremely short time remaining in the year make passage of such a bill highly improbable. The primary remaining path to a "Yes" is through high-stakes, chaotic negotiations over a must-pass bill at the end of the year, which is a low-probability scenario.

Final: 2%
