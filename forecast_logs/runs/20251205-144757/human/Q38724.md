### Reference class & base rates
*   **10-Year Changes in the NCES 302.60 Data Series:** The bet is on a 10-year change (2015-2025). Looking at previous 10-year periods for this specific data series (percent of 18-24 year-olds in 4-year institutions) provides the most direct reference class.
    *   **2005-2015:** The rate *increased* from 26.5% to 29.9% (+3.4 percentage points).
    *   **1995-2005:** The rate *increased* from 24.1% to 26.5% (+2.4 percentage points).
    *   **Reasoning:** Historically, this rate has been remarkably stable or increasing. A 10% relative drop (a 3.3 percentage point decline from 29.9%) has not occurred in recent decades.
    *   **Base Rate:** Based purely on this class, the probability of the rate falling below 26.6% would be very low, perhaps <5%. This was the core of Caplan's reasoning for making the bet in 2018.

*   **Post-Recession Enrollment Changes:** Major economic shocks can alter enrollment patterns. The 2008 Great Recession provides a relevant comparison.
    *   **2007-2011:** In the aftermath of the recession, the enrollment rate *increased* sharply from 27.2% to a peak of 30.6% as the weak labor market made college a more attractive option.
    *   **Reasoning:** This class suggests that negative economic shocks typically push enrollment *up*, not down.
    *   **Base Rate:** The probability of a large drop following a shock, based on this class, is also very low (<10%).

*   **Limitations:** Both primary reference classes are drawn from a pre-2020 world. They do not account for the unique nature of the COVID-19 pandemic (a health crisis and service-sector shutdown, not a typical financial crisis), the subsequent tight labor market, or the recent sharp rise in public skepticism about the value of higher education.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   [2024-05-21] FAFSA crisis deepens — ↓ — The botched rollout of the new FAFSA led to a 14% year-over-year decline in completions by May. This disproportionately affects low-income students and signals significant headwinds for Fall 2024 enrollment, which is a component of the 2025 data.
*   [2024-05-16] NSC reports Spring 2024 enrollment — ↓ — National Student Clearinghouse data showed a modest 1.2% increase in undergraduate enrollment, but this was driven by community colleges (+2.2%) and older students. Four-year institutions saw weaker growth (+0.7%), indicating a sluggish recovery in the sector relevant to the bet.
*   [2024-04-05] Strong March jobs report — ↓ — The US economy added 303,000 jobs, with unemployment at 3.8%. A persistently strong labor market for non-graduates increases the opportunity cost of college, pulling potential students into the workforce.
*   [2023-10-26] NSC reports Fall 2023 enrollment — ↑ (weak) — The first post-pandemic enrollment increase was recorded (+1.2% for undergrads). However, the total number of undergraduates remains nearly a million below Fall 2019 levels, suggesting the recovery is slow and partial.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **COVID-19 Shock & Aftermath:** The pandemic caused an unprecedented, sharp drop in enrollment in 2020 and 2021, particularly at 4-year institutions. The subsequent recovery has been weak, resetting the baseline enrollment level much lower than in 2015. (Size: Large)
*   **Strong Labor Market:** High demand for labor and rising wages for roles not requiring a degree create a powerful "pull" factor, incentivizing young people to work instead of enrolling in costly degree programs. (Size: Moderate)
*   **Cost and Perceived ROI:** The rising cost of tuition, significant student debt burdens, and a growing public narrative questioning the economic return of a college degree are eroding demand. (Size: Moderate)
*   **Demographic Cliff:** The number of US high school graduates is beginning to plateau and is projected to decline later this decade due to lower birth rates after 2008. This creates a structural headwind for enrollment. (Size: Small-to-Moderate)
*   **FAFSA Simplification Failure:** The chaotic 2024 rollout of the simplified FAFSA form created a major administrative barrier, suppressing applications and likely enrollment for the 2024-25 academic year. This is a significant, acute negative shock. (Size: Moderate)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Unprecedented Enrollment Shock:** Unlike the 2008 recession which *boosted* enrollment, the COVID-19 pandemic directly caused a massive, multi-year *decline*. The starting point for the 2022-2025 period is far lower than any historical trend would have predicted in 2018.
*   **Post-Shock Labor Market Dynamics:** The post-pandemic labor market is exceptionally tight, contrasting with the slack labor market post-2008. This has fundamentally altered the opportunity cost calculation for 18-24 year-olds.
*   **Mainstream Skepticism:** Public discourse questioning the value proposition of a four-year degree is far more prominent and widespread now than in the 1995-2015 period, influencing student and parent decisions.
*   **Acute Administrative Failure:** The FAFSA crisis is a novel, self-inflicted wound on the higher education system with no clear historical parallel in its scale and potential impact on a single year's enrollment numbers.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Based on stable historical trends from 1995-2018, the prior for Caplan winning (rate > 26.6%) should be very high, perhaps 85-90% (equivalent n ≈ 20-30 years of data showing stability or growth).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   ↓ **(Large)** The COVID-19 shock and the subsequent "new normal" of lower enrollment have already erased most of the buffer Caplan had. The 2022 rate was 27.5%, only 0.9 percentage points above the threshold.
    *   ↓ **(Moderate)** The persistent strength of the labor market for non-graduates provides a continuous downward pressure that did not exist in previous reference periods.
    *   ↓ **(Moderate)** The FAFSA crisis is a powerful, negative catalyst specifically impacting the Fall 2024 enrollment numbers, which are critical for the 2025 data point.
    *   ↓ **(Small)** The demographic decline is a background headwind that reinforces the negative trend.
*   **Net effect:** The post-2018 evidence is overwhelmingly negative for Caplan's position. The prior, based on a world that no longer exists, must be updated downwards dramatically. The probability has likely flipped from being strongly in his favor to being strongly against.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators (Caplan wins; rate > 26.6%)**
    *   National Student Clearinghouse (NSC) Fall 2024 enrollment report (due late 2024) shows a surprisingly strong rebound in 4-year institution enrollment.
    *   Data showing a rapid, late-summer surge in FAFSA completions and college commitments for Fall 2024.

To forecast whether Bryan Caplan will win his bet that the college enrollment rate will be greater than 26.6% in 2025, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The historical data from 1995 to 2015 shows a stable or increasing trend in college enrollment rates among 18-24 year-olds. The rate increased from 24.1% in 1995 to 29.9% in 2015. This suggests a strong historical base rate for stability or growth in enrollment rates.
   - Given this historical stability, a reasonable prior probability for the enrollment rate being above 26.6% in 2025 would be high, around 85-90%.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: Historically, enrollment rates have been stable or increasing, and economic downturns have typically led to increased enrollment.
   - Differences: The COVID-19 pandemic caused a significant drop in enrollment, and the current strong labor market provides an alternative to college for young adults. Additionally, public skepticism about the value of a college degree has increased.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **COVID-19 Shock:** The pandemic led to a sharp decline in enrollment, which has not fully recovered. This evidence suggests a lower likelihood of the rate being above 26.6%.
   - **Strong Labor Market:** The current labor market conditions make entering the workforce more attractive, decreasing the likelihood of higher enrollment.
   - **FAFSA Crisis:** The administrative issues with FAFSA could further suppress enrollment, particularly affecting low-income students.
   - **Demographic Trends:** A plateau in the number of high school graduates adds a structural challenge to maintaining high enrollment rates.
   - Likelihood ratios for these pieces of evidence suggest a decrease in the probability of the enrollment rate being above 26.6%.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Starting with a prior probability of 85-90%, the negative evidence from the COVID-19 impact, labor market conditions, FAFSA issues, and demographic trends significantly reduce this probability.
   - Conceptually, if we assume a prior odds of 9:1 (90% probability), and the cumulative likelihood ratio from the evidence is around 1:3 (favoring a decrease), the posterior odds would be 3:1 against Caplan winning.
   - This translates to a posterior probability of approximately 25%.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence in the historical trend could overlook the unprecedented nature of recent events.
   - Alternative scenarios, such as a sudden policy change or economic downturn leading to increased enrollment, could alter the outcome.
   - Considering these factors, a slight adjustment might be warranted to account for uncertainties and tail risks.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - After considering the base rate, evidence, and potential alternative scenarios, the final calibrated probability that Bryan Caplan will win his bet is:

Final: 25%

# Will Bryan Caplan win his bet that the college enrollment rate will be greater than 26.6% in 2025?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to establish a prior probability for whether the college enrollment rate for 18-24 year-olds in four-year colleges will exceed 26.6% in 2025.

The most appropriate reference class is historical 10-year changes in this specific metric. Looking at the data:
- 2005-2015: Increased from 26.5% to 29.9% (+3.4 percentage points)
- 1995-2005: Increased from 24.1% to 26.5% (+2.4 percentage points)

Historically, this rate has been remarkably stable or increasing. A 10% relative drop (which would be 3.3 percentage points from 29.9% to 26.6%) has not occurred in recent decades.

Based on this historical pattern alone, I would assign a prior probability of approximately 85% that Caplan will win his bet (i.e., that the rate will remain above 26.6%).

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- The fundamental value proposition of college education remains largely intact
- Employers still generally value four-year degrees for many positions
- The social norm of college attendance remains strong in many communities

**Key differences:**
- COVID-19 pandemic caused an unprecedented shock to college enrollment patterns
- The most recent data (2022) shows the rate at 27.5%, only 0.9 percentage points above the threshold
- The labor market is exceptionally tight for non-college graduates, unlike previous periods
- Public skepticism about college ROI has increased substantially
- The FAFSA application system failure in 2024 created a significant administrative barrier

These differences are substantial and suggest the historical pattern may not hold. The enrollment rate is already much closer to the threshold than would have been predicted in 2018 when Caplan made the bet.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: COVID-19 enrollment shock**
- P(E|H): If Caplan wins (rate > 26.6%), we would expect the COVID enrollment drop to be temporary with strong recovery. Moderate likelihood.
- P(E|~H): If Caplan loses (rate ≤ 26.6%), we would expect exactly the kind of persistent enrollment drop we've seen. High likelihood.
- Likelihood ratio: Approximately 0.5 (evidence against Caplan winning)

**Evidence 2: Current enrollment rate (27.5% in 2022)**
- P(E|H): If Caplan wins, we would expect the rate to be above but not too close to the threshold. The current rate is consistent but precarious.
- P(E|~H): If Caplan loses, we would expect the rate to be trending downward and approaching the threshold, which is exactly what we see.
- Likelihood ratio: Approximately 0.7 (evidence against Caplan winning)

**Evidence 3: FAFSA crisis in 2024**
- P(E|H): If Caplan wins, we would not expect a major administrative barrier to enrollment. Very low likelihood.
- P(E|~H): If Caplan loses, we would expect exactly this kind of negative shock. High likelihood.
- Likelihood ratio: Approximately 0.3 (strong evidence against Caplan winning)

**Evidence 4: Strong labor market for non-graduates**
- P(E|H): If Caplan wins, we would expect college to maintain its wage premium despite labor market conditions. Moderate likelihood.
- P(E|~H): If Caplan loses, we would expect exactly this kind of alternative opportunity drawing potential students away. High likelihood.
- Likelihood ratio: Approximately 0.6 (evidence against Caplan winning)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior of 85% (odds of 85:15 or 5.67:1) that Caplan wins his bet.

First update (COVID shock):
- Prior odds: 5.67:1
- Likelihood ratio: 0.5
- Posterior odds: 5.67 × 0.5 = 2.83:1
- Posterior probability: 2.83/(1+2.83) = 73.9%

Second update (Current rate close to threshold):
- Prior odds: 2.83:1
- Likelihood ratio: 0.7
- Posterior odds: 2.83 × 0.7 = 1.98:1
- Posterior probability: 1.98/(1+1.98) = 66.4%

Third update (FAFSA crisis):
- Prior odds: 1.98:1
- Likelihood ratio: 0.3
- Posterior odds: 1.98 × 0.3 = 0.59:1
- Posterior probability: 0.59/(1+0.59) = 37.1%

Fourth update (Strong labor market):
- Prior odds: 0.59:1
- Likelihood ratio: 0.6
- Posterior odds: 0.59 × 0.6 = 0.35:1
- Posterior probability: 0.35/(1+0.35) = 26.1%

After incorporating all the evidence, my posterior probability that Caplan will win his bet has dropped dramatically from 85% to approximately 26%.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots in my analysis:**
- I may be overweighting recent negative shocks and underestimating the resilience of higher education institutions
- The FAFSA crisis might be resolved more quickly than anticipated
- Economic conditions could change rapidly (recession could drive enrollment up)
- My analysis doesn't fully account for potential policy changes (loan forgiveness, free community college initiatives)

**Alternative forecast:**
A reasonable alternative forecast would be around 50%, arguing that:
- Historical stability of college enrollment suggests strong institutional inertia
- The 2022 rate of 27.5% provides some buffer above the 26.6% threshold
- Higher education institutions are actively working to recover enrollment
- The FAFSA issues might be resolved before significantly impacting 2025 data

**Rebuttal to alternative:**
While these points have merit, they don't fully account for:
- The magnitude of the COVID shock was unprecedented
- The current rate is already dangerously close to the threshold
- Multiple negative factors are compounding simultaneously
- The trend is clearly downward, not stable or recovering strongly

After considering these points, I will adjust my forecast slightly upward to account for institutional resilience, but the weight of evidence still points toward Caplan losing his bet.

## 6. Final Forecast

Based on historical patterns, current trends, and multiple compounding negative factors affecting college enrollment, I forecast a 30% probability that Bryan Caplan will win his bet that the college enrollment rate will be greater than 26.6% in 2025.

Final: 30%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most appropriate base rate for this forecast, as of the bet's inception in 2018, is the historical 10-year change in the percentage of 18-24 year-olds enrolled in 4-year colleges. The data from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) provides a direct reference class.

- **1995-2005:** The rate increased from 24.1% to 26.5% (+2.4 percentage points).
- **2005-2015:** The rate increased from 26.5% to 29.9% (+3.4 percentage points).

The bet is whether the rate will fall by more than 3.3 percentage points (from 29.9% to 26.6%) between 2015 and 2025. Historically, this rate has been remarkably stable and has consistently increased over 10-year periods. A decline of this magnitude was unprecedented in the decades leading up to the bet.

Therefore, the initial prior probability of Bryan Caplan winning (the rate staying above 26.6%) should be very high.
**Prior Probability P(H): 85%** (where H is the event "Caplan wins"). This corresponds to prior odds of 85/15 = 5.67 to 1 in favor of Caplan.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The situation in 2024 is profoundly different from the pre-2018 world that informed the base rate.

- **Similarities:** The forecast still concerns the same demographic group and the same data series. Fundamental drivers like the perceived value of education and economic opportunity costs remain central.
- **Differences:**
    1.  **COVID-19 Pandemic:** Unlike previous economic shocks (like the 2008 recession, which *increased* enrollment), the pandemic caused a direct, sharp, and sustained *decrease* in college enrollment. This was an exogenous shock that broke the historical trend.
    2.  **Post-Pandemic Labor Market:** The current labor market is exceptionally tight, with high demand for workers without college degrees. This creates a strong "pull" factor away from college, increasing the opportunity cost, a direct contrast to the slack labor market post-2008.
    3.  **Acute Administrative Failure:** The chaotic rollout of the new FAFSA form in 2024 has created a significant, novel barrier to enrollment for the 2024-25 academic year, a key period for the 2025 data point.
    4.  **Public Perception:** Skepticism about the return on investment of a four-year degree is far more mainstream now than in the period from 1995-2015.

These differences are fundamental and suggest that the historical base rate is no longer a reliable guide. The system's dynamics have changed.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
We must update the high prior with the powerful evidence that has emerged since 2018.

-   **Evidence 1: Actual Enrollment Decline (2015-2022).**
    -   The NCES data shows the rate has already fallen from 29.9% in 2015 to **27.5% in 2022**.
    -   This means that 2.4 percentage points of Caplan's 3.3-point buffer has already been erased. Only a 0.9-point margin remains (27.5% - 26.6%).
    -   **Likelihood Ratio:** This massive drop is far more likely in a world where Caplan loses (P(E|~H)) than one where he wins (P(E|H)). The evidence strongly favors the hypothesis that he will lose. This is a very strong update against the initial prior.

-   **Evidence 2: The 2024 FAFSA Crisis.**
    -   The botched FAFSA rollout has led to a significant year-over-year decline in application completions, which is a leading indicator for Fall 2024 enrollment.
    -   This creates a direct, negative pressure on the enrollment numbers for the academic year that will heavily influence the 2025 data point.
    -   **Likelihood Ratio:** An acute administrative failure depressing enrollment is much more probable if the final rate falls below the threshold (~H) than if it stays above it (H). This evidence further decreases the probability of Caplan winning.

-   **Evidence 3: Weak Enrollment Recovery & Strong Labor Market.**
    -   National Student Clearinghouse data for 2023 and Spring 2024 shows that while enrollment has stopped falling, the recovery is very weak, especially for 4-year institutions (+0.7%). This is not nearly enough to rebuild Caplan's buffer.
    -   Simultaneously, the strong labor market continues to pull potential students into the workforce.
    -   **Likelihood Ratio:** A weak recovery combined with a strong labor market makes a further dip below the threshold more likely (~H). This evidence also points toward Caplan losing.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
The initial prior of 85% was based on a world that no longer exists. The evidence since 2018 is overwhelmingly negative for Caplan's position.

-   **Initial State:** Prior odds are 5.67 to 1 in favor of Caplan.
-   **Update with COVID drop:** The fact that the rate is already at 27.5% is devastating evidence. This single fact likely flips the odds. Let's estimate this evidence makes losing at least 10 times more likely (Likelihood Ratio = 0.1).
    -   *Posterior Odds = 5.67 × 0.1 = 0.567 to 1.*
    -   This corresponds to a new probability of 0.567 / 1.567 = **36%**.
-   **Update with FAFSA crisis & other factors:** The FAFSA crisis is another major negative shock specifically timed to affect the resolution year. Combined with the persistent labor market pull, this makes a further drop highly probable. Let's apply another likelihood ratio of 0.3 (i.e., this evidence makes losing about 3.3 times more likely).
    -   *Final Odds = 0.567 × 0.3 = 0.17 to 1.*
    -   *Final Probability = 0.17 / 1.17 = 0.145.*

The resulting posterior probability is approximately **15%**.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
-   **Why might Caplan still win?** The most plausible scenario is a sharp economic downturn in late 2024 or early 2025. A recession would weaken the labor market, lowering the opportunity cost of college and potentially driving a surge in enrollment, similar to the post-2008 period.
-   **Alternative Scenario:** The impact of the FAFSA crisis could be overestimated, or a late surge in applications could mitigate the damage. The system might prove more resilient, with the rate stabilizing just above 26.6%.
-   **Rebuttal:** While a recession is possible, its timing and severity are uncertain. Relying on this scenario seems speculative. The known negative factors—the eroded buffer, the FAFSA crisis, demographic headwinds, and public sentiment—are concrete and already in motion. The path of least resistance is for the rate to drift below the 26.6% threshold. The current forecast of 15% adequately accounts for the small chance of a recession or other unexpected positive shock saving the bet for Caplan.

### 6. Final Forecast
The initial high probability of Caplan winning, based on stable pre-2018 trends, has been completely reversed by the unprecedented shocks of the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath. The enrollment rate has already fallen to within 1 percentage point of the threshold, and the acute FAFSA crisis in 2024 provides a strong catalyst for a further drop. While an economic recession could reverse the trend, the current evidence points strongly toward Caplan losing his bet.

Final: 15%
