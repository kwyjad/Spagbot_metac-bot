### Reference class & base rates
-   **Philippine Martial Law Declarations (Post-WWII):** There have been 3 declarations since 1946: 1972 (nationwide, by Marcos Sr.), 2009 (in Maguindanao province), and 2017 (in Mindanao). This suggests a base rate of approximately 4% per year (3 events / 79 years). However, two were geographically limited, and the current political context differs significantly from the catalysts for those events (communist insurgency, massacre, ISIS-linked siege).
-   **Years with Major Political Upheaval:** The Philippines has experienced several periods of intense political crisis, notably the 1983-1986 period leading to the People Power Revolution. This class is broader and more relevant to the unrest clauses. Including this period and other major coup attempts (e.g., late 1980s), a rough base rate for a year experiencing a crisis with the *potential* for 1,000+ deaths or 5,000+ arrests might be 5-10%.
-   **Global Instances of Post-Presidential Prosecution Leading to Major Unrest:** This is a weak reference class due to vast differences in political systems and cultures. However, the prosecution of popular, populist former leaders (e.g., Lula in Brazil, Zuma in South Africa) has led to significant protests, but rarely reaching the 1,000-death threshold. This suggests such an outcome is possible but rare.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
-   [2025-07-08] VP Sara Duterte publicly condemns the Marcos government's cooperation with the ICC from The Hague. — ↑ — Solidifies the political schism, framing the conflict as Marcos vs. Duterte and potentially galvanizing loyalists.
-   [2025-09-08] ICC postpones the confirmation of charges hearing for Rodrigo Duterte due to health concerns. — ↓ — Temporarily lowers the political temperature and delays a key potential trigger point for mass protests.
-   [2025-10-24] ICC judges reject Duterte's jurisdictional challenge, affirming the case will proceed. — ↑ — Closes a major legal off-ramp for Duterte, increasing the stakes and the perception that extra-legal (protest) action is the only remaining option for his supporters.
-   [2025-10-29] Duterte's legal team files an appeal of the ICC jurisdiction ruling and demands his release. — ↔ — A standard, expected legal maneuver that does not significantly alter the probability of unrest in the short term.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
-   **Duterte Loyalist Mobilization:** The core driver for unrest. The Duterte family commands significant, passionate support, particularly in their home region of Mindanao. A perception of political persecution could trigger large-scale, sustained protests. (Large impact)
-   **State Response to Protests:** The reaction of the Philippine National Police (PNP) and Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) is critical. A heavy-handed crackdown could easily escalate violence and lead to the death/arrest thresholds being met. Conversely, a permissive stance could embolden protestors but keep casualties low. (Large impact)
-   **Elite Fragmentation & Military Loyalty:** The open feud between the President and Vice President could split political and military elites. Any sign of wavering loyalty within the AFP/PNP leadership towards the Marcos administration would dramatically increase the risk of a major crisis, including a potential coup or declaration of martial law. (Moderate impact)
-   **ICC Actions as a Catalyst:** Further actions by the ICC, such as a formal indictment of Sara Duterte or a guilty verdict for her father, would serve as powerful, discrete trigger events for loyalist outrage and mobilization. (Moderate impact)
-   **Economic Conditions:** Worsening economic conditions (e.g., high inflation, unemployment) could broaden the appeal of anti-government protests beyond the core Duterte base, making them larger and harder to control. (Small to Moderate impact)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
-   **President vs. Vice President Conflict:** Unlike past crises (e.g., Marcos Sr. vs. Aquino opposition), the current conflict is between the two highest-ranking elected officials who ran on a unity ticket. This creates a unique and unstable dynamic within the executive branch itself.
-   **External Trigger (ICC):** The primary catalyst is an international judicial body, not a domestic event like a fraudulent election or a massacre. This may limit the resonance of the pro-Duterte cause among Filipinos who prioritize national sovereignty over the former president's fate.
-   **Unified Military Command (so far):** Historical crises, like the People Power Revolution, involved significant fractures within the military. Currently, the AFP and PNP leadership appear to be consolidated behind the constitutional order and the Marcos administration.
-   **Social Media's Role:** The speed and scale of mobilization (and disinformation) are amplified by social media to a degree unseen in previous major Philippine political crises, making events more volatile and unpredictable.
-   **Sitting VP as Opposition Leader:** Sara Duterte's position as Vice President gives her a significant national platform, resources, and a degree of legitimacy that past opposition figures lacked, making her a more formidable focal point for dissent.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
-   **Prior:** A base rate of ~5% for a year with this level of instability seems reasonable, reflecting the historical rarity of such events. This is a weak prior (equivalent n≈20).
-   **Evidence mapping:**
    -   ↑ (Large): The arrest of a popular former president is a significant shock to the political system.
    -   ↑ (Moderate): The open, escalating feud between the President and Vice President creates high-level instability.
    -   ↑ (Small): The ICC's rejection of jurisdictional challenges confirms the legal threat to the Dutertes is real and ongoing.
    -   ↓ (Moderate): The lack of sustained, massive protests in the eight months since Duterte's arrest suggests mobilization capacity may be lower than feared, or that a clear trigger is still awaited.
    -   ↓ (Moderate): The apparent continued loyalty of the military and police leadership to the Marcos administration acts as a powerful stabilizing force.
-   **Net effect:** The evidence points to a significantly more volatile situation than the historical average. The prior should be updated upwards considerably. However, with less than two months remaining in 2025 and the high thresholds for resolution, the probability remains below 50%. The net update is a significant increase from a low base rate.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
-   **UP indicators:**
    -   Sustained, large-scale protests (10,000+ people) in Davao City or other Mindanao urban centers.
    -   Any public statement of support for the Dutertes from active-duty flag-rank military or police officers.
    -   The ICC issuing an arrest warrant for Sara Duterte.
    -   President Marcos declaring a "state of emergency" or "state of lawless violence" in any region.
    -   A sharp, unexplained rise in political assassinations or violence in Mindanao.
-   **DOWN indicators:**
    -   Pro-Duterte rallies show dwindling attendance.
    -   AFP/PNP leadership issues strong, repeated public statements reaffirming loyalty to the constitution and the chain of command.
    -   VP Sara Duterte tones down her rhetoric or agrees to a political compromise with Marcos.
    -   Rodrigo Duterte's health deteriorates significantly, making him a less viable symbol for a political movement.
    -   Focus of the national conversation shifts decisively to the economy or other non-Duterte issues.

### Caveats & pitfalls
-   **Resolution Thresholds:** The question requires very specific and high thresholds (1,000 deaths / 5,000 arrests). The Philippines could experience significant, destabilizing civil unrest that falls short of these numbers, which would resolve as "No".
-   **Information Reliability:** Reporting on crowd sizes, arrests, and casualties during protests in the Philippines can be highly politicized and unreliable. Credible, neutral sources may be difficult to find in a chaotic environment.
-   **Scenario Specificity:** The provided background is a fictional scenario. This analysis is contingent on that specific narrative; real-world events would necessitate a complete re-evaluation.
-   **Black Swan Events:** The political situation is tense. An unpredictable event, such as an assassination attempt on a key political figure, could radically alter the dynamics overnight.
-   **Martial Law Definition:** While a nationwide declaration is unambiguous, a localized declaration (as in 2009 or 2017) would also trigger a "Yes" resolution. The bar for a localized declaration is lower than a national one.

**Final Research Summary:** The arrest of Rodrigo Duterte has created a tense political standoff between the allied Marcos and Duterte dynasties, significantly raising the risk of major unrest above the historical baseline. However, with less than two months left in 2025, the lack of sustained mass mobilization and the apparent stability of the security forces suggest the high thresholds for resolution are unlikely to be met.

To forecast the probability of major civil unrest or martial law in the Philippines in 2025, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Base Rate for Martial Law Declarations:** Historically, martial law has been declared in the Philippines 3 times since 1946, suggesting a base rate of approximately 4% per year. However, given the specific conditions required for this question (including unrest leading to 1,000 deaths or 5,000 arrests), a broader base rate for significant political upheaval is more appropriate.
- **Base Rate for Major Political Upheaval:** Considering periods of intense political crisis in the Philippines, a rough base rate for a year experiencing a crisis with the potential for 1,000+ deaths or 5,000+ arrests might be 5-10%. We'll use 7.5% as a midpoint for our prior probability.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** The current situation involves significant political tension, similar to past periods of unrest. The arrest of a former president and the political schism between the President and Vice President are reminiscent of historical political crises.
- **Differences:** The current conflict involves international legal proceedings (ICC), which is a unique factor. Additionally, the military and police appear unified behind the current administration, unlike past crises where military loyalty was divided.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Arrest of Duterte:** Increases probability. The arrest of a popular former leader is a significant political shock, likely to mobilize loyalists.
- **VP Sara Duterte's Opposition:** Increases probability. Her position as Vice President gives her a platform to galvanize support against the current administration.
- **ICC Proceedings:** Increases probability. The rejection of jurisdictional challenges heightens tensions and could trigger protests.
- **Lack of Mass Protests:** Decreases probability. The absence of large-scale protests since the arrest suggests lower mobilization capacity.
- **Military and Police Loyalty:** Decreases probability. The continued loyalty of security forces to the Marcos administration acts as a stabilizing factor.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
- **Prior Probability:** 7.5% (0.075 in probability terms)
- **Likelihood Ratios:**
  - Arrest of Duterte: Likelihood ratio > 1 (increases probability)
  - VP Sara Duterte's Opposition: Likelihood ratio > 1 (increases probability)
  - ICC Proceedings: Likelihood ratio > 1 (increases probability)
  - Lack of Mass Protests: Likelihood ratio < 1 (decreases probability)
  - Military and Police Loyalty: Likelihood ratio < 1 (decreases probability)

Given the mixed evidence, we adjust the prior upwards but remain below 50% due to the high thresholds for resolution and the stabilizing factors.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** The forecast should account for the possibility of rapid changes in the political landscape, such as unexpected military defections or a sudden surge in protests.
- **Alternative Scenarios:** Consider the potential for a black swan event, such as an assassination or a major economic downturn, which could drastically alter the situation.
- **Rebuttals:** While the current evidence suggests increased volatility, the lack of sustained unrest and the stability of security forces are strong counterarguments.

### 6. Final Forecast
- **Final Probability:** Considering the base rate, evidence, and potential for rapid changes, the probability of major civil unrest or martial law in the Philippines in 2025 is estimated at 20%.

Final: 20%

# Will there be major civil unrest or martial law in the Philippines in 2025?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to establish a prior probability based on historical patterns of civil unrest and martial law in the Philippines.

Looking at martial law declarations specifically, there have been 3 post-WWII declarations in the Philippines (1972, 2009, 2017) over 79 years, giving a base rate of approximately 3.8% per year. However, two of these were geographically limited.

For major civil unrest meeting the death/arrest thresholds, the Philippines has experienced several periods of significant political crisis, but few that reached the specific thresholds mentioned (1,000+ deaths or 5,000+ arrests in a year). The People Power Revolution and some periods of intense conflict in Mindanao might qualify.

Given these considerations, I'll use a base rate of 5% for a year experiencing either martial law or unrest meeting the specified thresholds. This reflects the historical rarity of such extreme events.

**Prior probability: 5%**

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- The Philippines continues to have underlying regional tensions, particularly in Mindanao
- Political dynasties remain influential in Philippine politics
- The country has a history of political polarization

**Differences from base case:**
- The current situation involves a direct conflict between the President and Vice President, creating unusual executive branch instability
- The arrest of a former president by an international body is unprecedented
- The specific Marcos-Duterte dynamic represents a clash between two powerful political families that previously allied
- Social media amplifies mobilization capabilities compared to historical crises
- With only about two months left in 2025, there's limited time for events to unfold to the resolution thresholds

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Arrest of Rodrigo Duterte by ICC**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.9) - If major unrest were to occur, the arrest of a popular former president would be a likely trigger
- P(E|~H): Low (~0.2) - Without major unrest, we would expect either no arrest or minimal public reaction to an arrest
- Likelihood ratio: ~4.5
- This significantly increases the probability of unrest

**Evidence 2: Eight months have passed since the arrest without threshold-level unrest**
- P(E|H): Low (~0.2) - If major unrest were imminent, we would expect to have seen significant mobilization already
- P(E|~H): High (~0.8) - Without major unrest, a period of relative calm is expected
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.25
- This decreases the probability of unrest

**Evidence 3: VP Sara Duterte's public opposition to the government**
- P(E|H): High (~0.8) - A sitting VP leading opposition increases likelihood of major unrest
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.4) - Political opposition can exist without triggering major unrest
- Likelihood ratio: ~2
- This moderately increases the probability

**Evidence 4: Military and police appear to remain loyal to Marcos administration**
- P(E|H): Low (~0.2) - Major unrest typically requires security force fragmentation
- P(E|~H): High (~0.8) - Unified security forces typically prevent threshold-level unrest
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.25
- This significantly decreases the probability

**Evidence 5: ICC rejection of Duterte's jurisdictional challenge**
- P(E|H): Moderate-high (~0.7) - This escalates the situation and removes a legal off-ramp
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.4) - Legal developments often occur without triggering unrest
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.75
- This moderately increases the probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 5:95 (0.05/(1-0.05) = 0.0526)

First update (Duterte arrest):
- Posterior odds = 0.0526 × 4.5 = 0.2367
- Posterior probability = 0.2367/(1+0.2367) ≈ 19.1%

Second update (Eight months without threshold-level unrest):
- Posterior odds = 0.2367 × 0.25 = 0.0592
- Posterior probability = 0.0592/(1+0.0592) ≈ 5.6%

Third update (VP Sara Duterte's opposition):
- Posterior odds = 0.0592 × 2 = 0.1184
- Posterior probability = 0.1184/(1+0.1184) ≈ 10.6%

Fourth update (Military loyalty to Marcos):
- Posterior odds = 0.1184 × 0.25 = 0.0296
- Posterior probability = 0.0296/(1+0.0296) ≈ 2.9%

Fifth update (ICC rejection of jurisdictional challenge):
- Posterior odds = 0.0296 × 1.75 = 0.0518
- Posterior probability = 0.0518/(1+0.0518) ≈ 4.9%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the speed at which unrest can escalate in the Philippines
- The limited time remaining in 2025 (less than two months) significantly constrains the probability
- The resolution criteria are very specific and high-threshold, which may lead to underestimation
- Social media's role in modern mobilization could accelerate events beyond historical patterns
- The Duterte family's popularity in Mindanao could be stronger than publicly apparent

**Alternative scenarios:**
- A sudden health crisis for Rodrigo Duterte could trigger immediate mass mobilization
- A localized declaration of martial law in Mindanao would resolve as "Yes" even without nationwide unrest
- The ICC could issue additional charges or arrest warrants against other Duterte allies, escalating tensions
- Military or police factions could suddenly declare support for the Dutertes, rapidly changing dynamics

After considering these factors, I believe my forecast may be slightly too low given the volatile situation. While the time constraint is significant, the specific resolution criteria include localized martial law, which has a lower threshold than nationwide unrest. The ICC case continues to develop and could produce trigger events.

## 6. Final Forecast

Considering all evidence and the limited time remaining in 2025, I adjust my final probability slightly upward from the Bayesian calculation to account for the possibility of rapid escalation and the lower threshold for localized martial law declarations.

Final: 7%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
To establish a prior probability, I will consider the historical frequency of events that would meet the resolution criteria in the Philippines. The question resolves "Yes" for either a declaration of martial law or major civil unrest (defined as 1,000+ deaths or 5,000+ arrests in the year).

*   **Martial Law:** Since the end of WWII (1946-2024, a period of 79 years), martial law has been declared three times: 1972 (nationwide), 2009 (Maguindanao province), and 2017 (Mindanao). This gives a base rate of 3/79, or approximately **3.8% per year**. Notably, two of these were localized, which is a lower bar to clear than a nationwide declaration.
*   **Major Civil Unrest:** The thresholds are high. The 1983-1986 People Power Revolution period would qualify. Other years with intense conflict, such as peaks in the communist or separatist insurgencies, might have crossed the 1,000-death threshold. The provided chart shows a peak of ~1,500 deaths in 1990. Let's estimate that perhaps 2-3 years in the last 40 have met this criterion due to political crises or insurgency. This suggests a base rate of roughly 5-7.5% per year.

Since the question is an "OR" condition and these events are correlated (a crisis could lead to both), I will select the higher of these rates as a conservative starting point.
**Initial Prior P(H): 5%**. This represents the chance of such an event occurring in a random year.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The scenario for 2025 is fundamentally different from an average year.

*   **Similarities:** The Philippines has a history of volatile politics, powerful political dynasties, and regional flashpoints like Mindanao.
*   **Differences:** The primary difference is the unprecedented trigger event: the arrest of a very popular and recent former president, Rodrigo Duterte, at the behest of the International Criminal Court (ICC). This has created a direct and public conflict between the sitting President (Bongbong Marcos) and Vice President (Sara Duterte, the former president's daughter). This is not a typical opposition movement; it is a fracture at the highest level of the executive branch, making the situation far more unstable than the baseline.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
Let H be the event that major unrest or martial law occurs in 2025.

*   **Evidence 1 (Pro-H): The arrest of Duterte and subsequent political crisis.** This includes the arrest itself, VP Sara Duterte's condemnation of the government, and the ICC rejecting legal challenges.
    *   P(E1 | H): Very high. If major unrest were to occur in 2025, this crisis would almost certainly be the cause.
    *   P(E1 | ~H): Low to Moderate. It is plausible for such a crisis to occur and be managed politically without escalating to the resolution thresholds.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Strongly greater than 1. This evidence dramatically increases the probability from the base rate for the year 2025.

*   **Evidence 2 (Anti-H): The passage of time without resolution.** The forecast is made on November 3, 2025. The primary trigger event occurred in March. Approximately eight months of this high-tension period have passed without the thresholds for death, arrests, or martial law being met.
    *   P(E2 | H): Low. If the situation was destined to explode into major unrest in 2025, it is more likely than not that it would have already happened or shown much clearer signs of escalation in the eight months following the arrest.
    *   P(E2 | ~H): High. This is precisely what we would expect to see if the political system, while stressed, was successfully containing the crisis below the resolution thresholds.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Significantly less than 1. This is a powerful piece of evidence that reduces the probability.

*   **Evidence 3 (Anti-H): Apparent loyalty of the security forces.** The research report notes that the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) and Philippine National Police (PNP) leadership appear consolidated behind the Marcos administration.
    *   P(E3 | H): Low. Major unrest is much harder to sustain and far more likely to be suppressed if the state's security apparatus remains unified and loyal. A historical precedent like the People Power Revolution involved significant military defections.
    *   P(E3 | ~H): High. A loyal military is a feature of a stable, functioning state, even one under political stress.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Less than 1. This evidence further decreases the probability.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
1.  **Start with the Prior:** P(H) = 5%, or prior odds of 1-to-19.
2.  **Update for the Crisis:** The unique political crisis (Evidence 1) makes 2025 a special case. Let's estimate this increases the odds for the year by a factor of 5 (a significant but not extreme update).
    *   New odds = (1/19) * 5 = 5/19.
    *   This implies a probability for the entire year of P(H_year) = 5 / (5 + 19) = 5/24 ≈ 21%.
3.  **Update for Time Passed (Evidence 2):** We now must account for the fact that 10/12 of the year has passed without the event. The initial 21% risk was for the whole year. The fact that we have survived the most likely period of immediate backlash after the March arrest is strong evidence that the overall risk was either lower than 21% or that the remaining risk is small. Let's assume the hazard rate is not uniform and that most of the risk (e.g., 80%) was in the first 10 months. We have survived that period. The remaining risk is for the last two months, which would be a fraction of the initial 21% estimate, and further discounted by the fact that the lack of an earlier event makes a future one less likely. This update brings the probability down substantially, likely into the single digits. For instance, if 20% of the initial 21% risk remains, that's about 4.2%.
4.  **Final Adjustment:** The loyalty of the military (Evidence 3) provides an additional downward pressure. The most plausible path to a "Yes" is now a localized martial law declaration in Mindanao, which President Marcos might use as a tool to quell protests, even if they don't meet the death/arrest thresholds. This path keeps the probability from falling to near-zero.

Combining these factors, the initial high risk has been significantly mitigated by the passage of time and the stability of state institutions. The remaining probability for the last two months of 2025 is low, but not negligible.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My analysis could be flawed. I might be underestimating the potential for a new, sudden trigger, such as an ICC conviction of Duterte or an arrest warrant for his daughter, to cause an explosive reaction that was simply dormant, not dissipated. I might also be too confident in the stability of the military; loyalties can shift quickly. The Marcos administration could also overreact to smaller protests and declare martial law as a pretext to consolidate power, a path that would resolve the question "Yes".

Conversely, I might be underestimating the political incentives on both sides to find an off-ramp and de-escalate. The high thresholds are a significant barrier, and the Philippines could experience considerable turmoil that still resolves "No".

Balancing these considerations, a forecast in the high single digits seems appropriate. It reflects a situation that is much more dangerous than normal but where the immediate danger seems to have passed and the remaining time is short.

### Final Forecast
The initial shock of former President Duterte's arrest created a period of high risk. However, the subsequent eight months have passed without major unrest, and the security forces appear to remain loyal to the government. This is strong evidence that the system is resilient. With less than two months remaining in 2025, the probability of an event meeting the high resolution thresholds is low. The most plausible, albeit still unlikely, scenario is a localized declaration of martial law in Mindanao in response to regional protests.

Final: 8%
