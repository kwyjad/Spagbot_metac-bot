### Reference class & base rates
1.  **States of Emergency (SoE) under the Noboa Administration (Nov 2023 - Present):** This is the most relevant reference class. President Noboa has shown a high propensity to use SoEs as a primary security tool. In his first year, he declared a nationwide (24 provinces) SoE in January 2024, followed by a localized SoE in seven provinces in May 2024, and now a 16-province SoE in October 2025.
    *   **Base Rate:** At any given point during this administration, a significant number of provinces have been under an SoE. A rough estimate suggests that on an average day in this period, ~10-15% of provinces (2-4 provinces) might be under a localized SoE, with spikes to 100% (24 provinces) during nationwide crises. The current situation (16 provinces) is a high point for a localized SoE.
    *   **Limitations:** This is a short time series, making it highly sensitive to recent events. Noboa's initial term is short (ending mid-2025), creating unique political incentives. *Correction: The prompt implies Noboa is still president in Oct 2025, suggesting he won re-election. This strengthens the relevance of his established playbook.*

2.  **Ecuadorian SoEs in Response to Social Protests (2015-2025):** This class captures the specific driver of the current SoE. Major protests, often led by indigenous confederation CONAIE over economic policies (e.g., fuel subsidy cuts), have historically prompted SoEs (e.g., 2019, 2022). These are typically widespread but often resolved through negotiation faster than security-focused SoEs.
    *   **Base Rate:** During major protest cycles, it's common for 5-10 provinces (the Andean and Amazonian core of the protests) to be placed under an SoE. These SoEs rarely last their full constitutional term, often being lifted as part of a political settlement.
    *   **Limitations:** The current administration's strategy of linking protesters to foreign cartels and terrorism is a departure from past government responses, potentially altering the duration and intensity.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-10-06** Expansion of SoE — ↑ — The state of emergency was expanded to 16 provinces, including key coastal regions, indicating the crisis is perceived as widespread and severe.
*   **2025-10-05** Arrests for attempted assassination — ↑ — The government's claim of an assassination attempt, whether credible or not, provides a strong justification for maintaining and extending the SoE.
*   **2025-10-04** SoE declared in 10 provinces — ↑ — The initial declaration in response to protests over diesel subsidies established the current crisis, setting a 60-day clock on the measures.
*   **2025-10-03** Escalation of violence — ↑ — Reports of soldiers injured and kidnapped provided the immediate trigger for the government's forceful response, framing the protests as violent and illegitimate.
*   **2025-09-16** Pre-existing SoE in Carchi and Imbabura — (neutral) — Shows that the government was already using SoEs for security in specific northern provinces, but the new driver is social protest, not border security.
*   **2024-01-08** Nationwide SoE declared — ↑ — This event, though outside the 6-month recency window, is critical as it established Noboa's "internal armed conflict" doctrine and his willingness to use maximal security measures.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Constitutional Time Limits:** Ecuadorian law typically limits SoEs to 60 days, with one possible 30-day extension. The SoE declared on Oct 4 will expire around Dec 3. For it to be active on Dec 25, it must be renewed. This is the single most important mechanism. (Size: Large)
2.  **Noboa's "Mano Dura" (Iron Fist) Strategy:** The president has consistently framed security and social challenges as battles against "terrorists" (gangs, and now protesters). This rhetoric makes de-escalation and negotiation difficult and increases the likelihood of extending security measures. (Size: Large)
3.  **Protest Endurance & Negotiation:** The capacity of indigenous and social movements to sustain protests versus the government's willingness to negotiate on the core issue (diesel subsidies) will determine if the crisis resolves before the SoE expires or needs renewal. (Size: Moderate)
4.  **Persistence of Organized Crime:** The underlying security crisis from gang violence has not disappeared. The government may use the protest-driven SoE as a pretext to continue military operations against gangs in key provinces (e.g., Guayas, El Oro), justifying an extension even if protests subside. (Size: Moderate)
5.  **Holiday Season Dynamics:** The period leading up to Christmas can be a catalyst for either resolution (a "Christmas truce") or heightened security measures to prevent disruptions during a commercially and socially important time. Given the "terrorist" framing, the latter is more likely. (Size: Small)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Conflation of Drivers:** Unlike past protest-driven SoEs (Reference Class 2), Noboa is explicitly linking social demonstrators to foreign cartels and terrorism. This is a tactic from his anti-gang playbook (Reference Class 1) being applied to a different problem, making a negotiated settlement less likely.
*   **Scale of Localized SoE:** At 16 provinces, this is an exceptionally large "localized" SoE, bordering on a de facto nationwide declaration. This suggests the perceived threat is higher, or the political utility of the SoE is greater, than in typical protest events.
*   **President's Political Position:** Having presumably won re-election, Noboa may feel he has a strong mandate for his hardline security policies, making him less likely to compromise with protesters compared to a president with weaker political standing.
*   **Economic Pressure:** The underlying cause—subsidy cuts—points to severe fiscal pressure on the government. This pressure limits the government's ability to offer the concessions that have historically ended major protest cycles.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a prior centered on a low number of provinces (e.g., a Poisson distribution with a mean of 2-3), reflecting the base rate of persistent but localized security issues. Give this a moderate strength (equivalent n of ~10-15 observations) based on the last two years of activity.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑ Large) An SoE is currently active in 16 provinces, providing a very high anchor point just two months before the resolution date.
    *   (↓ Moderate) The 60-day constitutional limit forces an expiration (~Dec 3) before the resolution date. The key uncertainty is renewal, not continuation.
    *   (↑ Large) Noboa's established playbook and rhetoric ("terrorists," "assassination attempt") strongly suggest an unwillingness to back down and a high propensity to renew or re-declare the SoE.
    *   (↑ Moderate) The conflation of protest with organized crime provides a dual justification for extending the SoE, even if one of the threats subsides.
    *   (↓ Small) Protest-driven SoEs have historically been shorter than crime-driven ones, as they are subject to political negotiation. However, this effect is likely diminished by the current administration's approach.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence overwhelmingly pushes the posterior up from the low-single-digit prior. The high current number (16) and Noboa's political posture are powerful signals. The constitutional limit acts as a drag, but renewal is highly plausible. The posterior distribution should be centered significantly higher, likely in the 8-16 province range, with a mode around 10-14.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Official government statements in late November/early December announcing the 30-day renewal of the SoE.
    *   Continued violent clashes between protesters and security forces.
    *   Failure of any formal dialogue between the government and indigenous leaders.
    *   New government accusations linking protest leaders to criminal organizations.
    *   Major acts of violence (e.g., bombings, high-profile kidnappings) attributed to any group in the affected provinces.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   The government announces a successful negotiation and agreement on fuel subsidies.
    *   A significant, observable decrease in protest activity and roadblocks across the country.
    *   The Constitutional Court rules against an extension of the SoE.
    *   The government allows the SoE to expire on ~Dec 3 without immediate renewal, perhaps keeping it only in 1-2 key provinces.
    *   Major international pressure for de-escalation and human rights protection.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Fictional Premise:** The entire scenario is based on the provided fictional background from October 2025. This analysis assumes those facts are true and extrapolates from them based on real-world patterns.
*   **Definitional Ambiguity:** A "state of emergency" can vary in scope and enforcement. The resolution is a binary count, but the on-the-ground reality could be a patchwork of different levels of enforcement.
*   **Information Asymmetry:** Government reports on violence levels, assassination attempts, and cartel involvement may be exaggerated to justify its political and security strategy.
*   **Sudden De-escalation:** Despite the hardline rhetoric, a backroom deal or a sudden political calculation could lead to an abrupt end to the crisis and the lifting of the SoE, a common feature in Ecuadorian politics.
*   **Scope Change:** The government could let the broad 16-province SoE expire and immediately declare a new, more limited one in a smaller number of "hotspot" provinces, which would still resolve to a number > 0.

**Final Research Summary:** The forecast hinges on the high probability that President Noboa will renew the current, expansive state of emergency beyond its early December expiration date. His established hardline strategy and

To forecast the number of provinces in Ecuador that will be in a state of emergency on December 25, 2025, we will follow the outlined Bayesian reasoning process.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - **Base Rate:** The most relevant base rate is the historical use of states of emergency (SoE) under President Noboa's administration. Historically, the average number of provinces under SoE has been around 2-4, with spikes to 24 during nationwide crises. Given the current situation with 16 provinces under SoE, the base rate for a localized SoE is higher than usual.
   - **Mean/Median and Variance:** The mean is approximately 3 provinces, with a variance reflecting occasional spikes to 24.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - **Similarity:** The current situation is similar to past instances where Noboa has used SoEs extensively, especially in response to security threats.
   - **Difference:** The current SoE is driven by social protests linked to economic policies, with an added dimension of alleged foreign cartel involvement, which is a departure from purely security-driven SoEs.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Current SoE in 16 provinces:** Strong evidence that the situation is severe and widespread, suggesting a higher likelihood of continuation or renewal.
   - **Constitutional limits:** The SoE must expire around December 3, unless renewed, which is a downward pressure.
   - **Noboa's rhetoric and strategy:** Increases the likelihood of renewal due to his hardline stance.
   - **Holiday season dynamics:** Slight upward pressure due to potential for heightened security measures.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - **Prior:** Start with a Poisson distribution centered around 3 provinces.
   - **Likelihoods:** Adjust upwards due to the current high number (16) and Noboa's strategy, balanced by the constitutional limit.
   - **Posterior Mean/Variance:** The posterior distribution shifts upwards, with a mean around 10-14 provinces, reflecting the likelihood of renewal.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the possibility of a sudden de-escalation or a more limited renewal.
   - **Tail Risks:** The risk of a nationwide SoE remains, but is less likely given the current context.
   - **Alternative Forecast:** A scenario where the SoE is not renewed, or only partially renewed, could result in a lower number, but this is less consistent with current evidence.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Based on the analysis, the forecasted percentiles are as follows:

P10: 6  
P20: 8  
P40: 10  
P60: 12  
P80: 14  
P90: 16

# Forecast: How many provinces in Ecuador will be in a state of emergency on December 25, 2025?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll use two reference classes to establish my prior:

**Primary reference class**: States of Emergency (SoE) under the Noboa administration (Nov 2023-Oct 2025)
- Noboa has shown a clear pattern of using SoEs as a security tool
- January 2024: Nationwide SoE (24 provinces)
- May 2024: Localized SoE (7 provinces)
- September 2025: SoE in 2 provinces (Carchi and Imbabura)
- October 2025: Expanded to 16 provinces

**Secondary reference class**: Ecuadorian SoEs in response to social protests (2015-2025)
- Protest-driven SoEs typically affect 5-10 provinces
- Often resolved through negotiation before their full term expires

Based on these patterns, my prior distribution is centered around 3-4 provinces (15% of Ecuador's 24 provinces) being under SoE at any given time, with significant variance (0-24 provinces) reflecting the episodic nature of these declarations.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate**:
- Same president (Noboa) with established security playbook
- Similar underlying drivers (security concerns, social protests)
- Constitutional constraints on SoE duration remain the same

**Key differences**:
- Current SoE is unusually large (16 provinces) for a non-nationwide declaration
- Noboa has explicitly linked protesters to terrorism and cartels, unlike previous protest-driven SoEs
- The December 25 resolution date falls ~22 days after the initial 60-day SoE would expire
- The economic pressure driving subsidy cuts limits government's ability to offer concessions

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence pushing forecast upward**:
- Current high baseline (16 provinces under SoE) provides strong anchor (likelihood ratio ~5:1 favoring higher outcomes)
- Noboa's "terrorist" framing of protesters makes negotiated settlement less likely (likelihood ratio ~3:1 favoring higher outcomes)
- Alleged assassination attempt provides strong justification for maintaining security measures (likelihood ratio ~2:1 favoring higher outcomes)
- Dual justification (protests + organized crime) gives flexibility to maintain SoE even if one threat subsides (likelihood ratio ~2:1 favoring higher outcomes)

**Evidence pushing forecast downward**:
- Constitutional 60-day limit means current SoE expires around December 3, requiring renewal to be active on December 25 (likelihood ratio ~3:1 favoring lower outcomes)
- Protest-driven SoEs historically resolve faster than security-driven ones (likelihood ratio ~1.5:1 favoring lower outcomes)
- Holiday season could incentivize government to normalize situation (likelihood ratio ~1.2:1 favoring lower outcomes)

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with my prior centered around 3-4 provinces, I'll update based on the strongest evidence:

**First update**: Current high baseline (16 provinces)
- This dramatically shifts my distribution upward
- Posterior mean moves from ~3-4 to ~10-12 provinces

**Second update**: Constitutional expiration (~Dec 3) before resolution date
- This creates a bimodal distribution with:
  - One mode near 0 (if SoE expires without renewal)
  - One mode around 12-16 (if SoE is renewed)
- The probability mass shifts toward the lower mode, but remains weighted toward renewal given Noboa's pattern

**Third update**: Noboa's terrorism framing and security-first approach
- This shifts probability back toward the higher mode
- Posterior becomes less bimodal, with more weight on outcomes in the 8-16 range

After these updates, my posterior distribution has:
- Mean: ~10 provinces
- Significant probability mass in the 8-16 range
- Some probability of both lower outcomes (0-4 provinces) and higher outcomes (16-24 provinces)

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots**:
- I may be overweighting the current situation (16 provinces) without fully accounting for the constitutional reset at 60 days
- I might underestimate the government's ability to negotiate a settlement with protesters
- The "terrorism" framing could be political rhetoric rather than a genuine security assessment

**Alternative scenarios**:
- **Low-end scenario**: SoE expires on December 3 and is not renewed due to successful negotiations or international pressure (0 provinces)
- **Mid-range scenario**: SoE is renewed but scaled back to focus only on provinces with ongoing violence (5-8 provinces)
- **High-end scenario**: Current SoE is renewed at full scale or expanded nationwide due to escalation (16-24 provinces)

**Adjustments needed**:
- I should widen my distribution to account for the genuine possibility of both complete expiration (0) and nationwide expansion (24)
- The bimodal nature of the distribution (either renewed or not) needs to be preserved in my percentiles

## 6. Final Percentiles

After considering all evidence and potential blind spots, my final forecast distribution reflects:
- A significant probability of renewal (60-70%)
- A meaningful probability of expiration without renewal (20-30%)
- A small probability of expansion to nationwide SoE (5-10%)

P10: 0
P20: 0
P40: 8
P60: 14
P80: 16
P90: 20

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The target variable is the number of Ecuadorian provinces (out of 24) under a state of emergency (SoE) on a specific future date. A suitable base rate is the general prevalence of SoEs in Ecuador during periods of relative stability, punctuated by crises. On a "random" day without a major declared crisis, the number of provinces under an SoE is typically very low, often zero. The persistent security challenges on the border or in specific cities might warrant a localized SoE in 1-3 provinces.

Therefore, I'll select a prior distribution heavily skewed towards zero, representing the state of affairs *between* major crises. This prior would have a median of 0 and a mean of approximately 1, reflecting that most of the time, most of the country is not under an SoE, but small-scale declarations are possible.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

The current situation is fundamentally different from the base case. We are not on a "random day" but in the midst of a significant, ongoing crisis.
*   **Similarity:** The use of SoEs as a government tool is consistent with historical patterns.
*   **Differences:**
    1.  **High Starting Point:** There is an active SoE in 16 of 24 provinces, which is an extremely high anchor point compared to the prior of 0-1.
    2.  **Timing:** The current 60-day SoE is set to expire around December 3, 2025, which is *before* the resolution date of December 25. The core uncertainty is not continuation, but **renewal**.
    3.  **Political Strategy:** President Noboa's administration has a distinct "Mano Dura" (Iron Fist) strategy. His framing of these social protests as being linked to foreign cartels and terrorism is a significant departure from how previous governments handled similar events. This rhetoric makes a negotiated settlement less likely and a security-based extension more probable.
    4.  **Political Mandate:** The scenario implies Noboa has won re-election, likely strengthening his mandate to pursue his established hardline security policies without the need for pre-election compromise.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will update my prior based on the current evidence.

*   **Evidence 1: Active SoE in 16 provinces.** This is powerful evidence that makes high-number outcomes much more likely than my low-number prior. It establishes the immediate context and a high anchor. (Pushes forecast strongly up).
*   **Evidence 2: Constitutional 60-day limit.** This is the strongest piece of evidence for a low outcome. The SoE will mechanically end before Dec 25 unless a specific action (renewal) is taken. (Pushes forecast strongly down, towards 0).
*   **Evidence 3: Noboa's playbook and rhetoric.** His history (e.g., Jan 2024 nationwide SoE) and current actions (linking protesters to "terrorists," publicizing an "assassination attempt") strongly suggest an unwillingness to de-escalate. This makes a 30-day renewal, which is constitutionally permitted and would cover the resolution date, highly probable. (This evidence strongly counters Evidence 2, pushing the forecast back up).
*   **Evidence 4: Conflation of protest and crime.** By linking the protests to the ongoing fight against organized crime, the government has a dual justification to extend the SoE. Even if protests subside, the government can argue for renewal based on the underlying security threat in key provinces (e.g., Guayas, El Oro, Manabí). (This increases the probability of a non-zero outcome, particularly a partial renewal).

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

My prior was centered at 0-1. The evidence creates a strong tension between the SoE's automatic expiration (pushing to 0) and the high probability of renewal (pushing to a high number). The posterior distribution will therefore not be a simple bell curve but will be multi-modal.

*   **Update Step:** I estimate the probability of the SoE not being renewed (or being replaced by nothing) at around 20%. This "de-escalation" scenario could happen due to successful back-channel negotiations, a ruling by the Constitutional Court, or a political calculation to ease tensions before Christmas. This 20% probability mass is centered around 0-2 provinces.
*   **The Renewal Scenarios (80% probability):** If the SoE is renewed, it could be at different scales:
    *   **Full Renewal (~16 provinces):** The government doubles down. I assign this a ~25% probability (20% of the total).
    *   **Significant Partial Renewal (8-12 provinces):** The most likely outcome. The government focuses on the main protest centers and/or crime hotspots, showing it is still in control while appearing to scale back. I assign this a ~40% probability (32% of total).
    *   **Minimal Renewal (3-7 provinces):** A token renewal to maintain a security posture in a few key areas. I assign this a ~35% probability (28% of total).

This creates a posterior distribution with a significant chance (20%) of a low outcome (0-2) but with the bulk of the probability mass (80%) distributed between 3 and 16 provinces, with a central tendency around 8-10.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

I need to challenge my own assumptions.
*   **Risk of Overconfidence in Renewal:** Am I underestimating the power of protest movements like CONAIE to force a negotiation, as they have in the past? While Noboa's style is different, the economic and social pressure could be immense. My 20% chance of non-renewal accounts for this, and it feels appropriate given the confrontational framing by the government.
*   **Possibility of Escalation:** My model largely caps the outcome at 16. However, the Jan 2024 precedent shows Noboa is willing to declare a nationwide (24 province) SoE. If the situation deteriorates further, he could expand the current SoE. This is a tail risk on the high end. I must ensure my upper percentiles (P80, P90) account for outcomes between 16 and 24.
*   **Sudden Resolution:** A "Christmas truce" or a sudden political deal could lead to an abrupt lifting of all measures. This is the primary driver for the low-end scenarios.
*   **Adjustment:** I will adjust my upper percentiles to reflect the small but real possibility of escalation beyond the current 16 provinces. My P90 should be higher than 16 to capture this tail risk. My central estimates and lower percentiles seem robust.

### 6. Final Percentiles

My final distribution reflects these scenarios. There is a meaningful chance of the SoE expiring without renewal, leading to a low number. However, the most probable set of outcomes involves a renewal, likely partial, keeping the number of provinces in the high single digits or low double digits. The tail risks include a full renewal or even an expansion.

P10: 0
P20: 2
P40: 7
P60: 10
P80: 16
P90: 20
