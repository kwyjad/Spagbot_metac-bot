### Research Plan

**1. Core Questions to Investigate:**

*   **Q1: What is the historical precedent for selecting COP hosts, especially in cases of contested bids within a regional group?** How often do these contests occur, and how are they typically resolved? How often does the "default to Bonn" scenario happen?
*   **Q2: What are the specific strengths and weaknesses of the Australian bid?** This includes its climate policy credibility, diplomatic support within the Western European and Others Group (WEOG), logistical capacity, and the narrative power of co-hosting with Pacific Island Nations.
*   **Q3: What are the specific strengths and weaknesses of the Turkish bid?** This includes its climate policy, diplomatic standing within WEOG, logistical readiness, and the narrative it presents.
*   **Q4: What is the current geopolitical landscape within WEOG?** Are there any existing alliances or tensions that would favor one candidate over the other? Key actors to consider are the US, the EU bloc, Canada, and Israel.
*   **Q5: What are the key decision-making criteria?** Is it primarily climate ambition, geopolitical horse-trading, logistical convenience, or a combination?
*   **Q6: What recent events (last 6-12 months) have materially changed the odds for either candidate?** This includes policy announcements, diplomatic statements, and reports on the bidding process.

**2. Search Queries:**

*   **Q1 (Precedent):** `"UNFCCC COP host selection process"`, `"history of contested COP host bids"`, `"COP29 Eastern European Group host decision"`, `"has a COP ever defaulted to Bonn"`
*   **Q2 (Australia Bid):** `"Australia COP 31 bid support"`, `"Pacific nations view on Australia COP 31"`, `"WEOG members support Australia COP 31 bid"`, `"Australia climate policy 2025 NDC"`
*   **Q3 (Turkey Bid):** `"Turkey COP 31 bid details"`, `"Turkey climate action plan 2025"`, `"Turkey relations with EU on climate"`, `"Turkey Paris Agreement NDC status"`
*   **Q4 (Geopolitics):** `"WEOG members list"`, `"Turkey relations with WEOG members"`, `"Australia diplomatic relations WEOG"`, `"US position on COP 31 host"`
*   **Q5 (Criteria):** `"criteria for hosting UNFCCC COP"`, `"importance of climate ambition in COP host selection"`
*   **Q6 (Recent Events):** `"COP 31 host news 2025"`, `"Australia climate announcements September 2025"`, `"Turkey environmental policy updates 2025"`

**3. Synthesis of Findings:**

The selection process is political and requires consensus within the regional group. Contested bids are not uncommon; the recent selection of Azerbaijan for COP29 after a deadlock in the Eastern European Group (EEG) is a key precedent, showing that compromises are strongly preferred over the default Bonn option. The default is a sign of diplomatic failure and is actively avoided.

Australia's bid has a strong narrative advantage by partnering with climate-vulnerable Pacific nations. Critically, the provided sources show a major, recent push to bolster its climate credentials with an ambitious 2035 NDC (62-70% reduction) announced in September 2025. This appears strategically timed to address historical criticisms of Australia as a climate laggard and directly strengthen its case ahead of the decision.

Turkey's bid is geographically convenient but faces geopolitical headwinds. Its relationship with several key EU members within WEOG can be complex, and its own climate policy track record has been less consistently ambitious than Australia's recent announcements. There is less public information available about a recent, concerted diplomatic or policy push for its bid compared to Australia's.

The decision will likely hinge on which candidate can build a consensus bloc. Australia can likely count on support from the CANZUK countries (Canada, NZ, UK), the US, and Pacific-aligned nations. Turkey's support base is less clear. The EU may not vote as a single bloc. The recent, tangible policy actions from Australia provide a strong, objective justification for other nations to lend their support.

**4. Draft Comprehensive Answer:**

---

### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Contested COP Host Bids within a UN Regional Group:** This is the most relevant class. The recent COP29 host selection for the Eastern European Group (EEG) saw a deadlock between Russia-backed and EU-backed candidates, ultimately resolved by a compromise candidate (Azerbaijan). This suggests deadlocks are resolved through negotiation, not default. In a two-candidate race, the base rate for either winning is roughly **40-50%**.
2.  **Default Host Scenario (Bonn, Germany):** The conference defaults to Bonn only if consensus fails. This is historically very rare, as it represents a significant diplomatic failure for the regional group. The base rate for this outcome is very low, likely **<10%**.
3.  **Bids from High-Capacity, Developed Nations:** Both Australia and Turkey fit this class. Such bids are generally successful if they achieve regional consensus. The key variable is the internal group politics, not the intrinsic capacity to host.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-10-13** Australia's updated NDC submission for 2035 (62-70% reduction) is formally noted. — ↑ Australia — Provides concrete, ambitious climate action to back its bid, addressing past criticisms.
*   **2025-09-18** Australian Government releases its detailed Net Zero Plan and six sector-specific plans. — ↑ Australia — Demonstrates a serious, whole-of-government approach to climate policy, enhancing credibility.
*   **2025-09-18** Australian Government officially announces its ambitious 2035 emissions reduction target. — ↑ Australia — A major, strategically timed policy move designed to bolster its COP31 bid.
*   **2024-11-15** South Australia (proposed host state) advances legislation for more ambitious 2030 targets. — ↑ Australia — Shows sub-national commitment and readiness, strengthening the logistical and political case.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Consensus Building within WEOG:** The entire decision rests on achieving consensus. Diplomatic maneuvering, alliances, and trade-offs are the primary mechanism. (Size: Large)
2.  **Demonstrated Climate Ambition:** A country's recent climate policy actions (like new NDCs) serve as crucial evidence of its commitment and suitability to lead global climate talks. (Size: Moderate-Large)
3.  **Geopolitical Alignment:** Pre-existing relationships and tensions (e.g., Turkey-EU relations, Australia's ties to CANZUK/US) will heavily influence support. A lack of major objectors is as important as strong supporters. (Size: Moderate)
4.  **Narrative Strength:** The "story" of the bid matters. Australia's partnership with vulnerable Pacific nations is a powerful, emotionally resonant narrative that aligns with the goals of the Paris Agreement. (Size: Moderate)
5.  **Logistical Feasibility:** Both candidates are capable of hosting, making this a minor factor unless significant issues arise. It's a necessary but not sufficient condition. (Size: Small)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Novel Co-Host Model:** Australia's bid is not just for itself but explicitly in partnership with Pacific Island Nations. This is a unique and politically savvy model not common in past bids.
*   **Strategic Policy Timing:** Australia has very recently (within the last 2 months) unveiled a suite of ambitious climate policies that seem explicitly timed to counter its historical reputation and strengthen its bid just before the decision period.
*   **Diverse Regional Group:** WEOG is unusually diverse, containing the EU bloc, the Anglosphere (US, CANZUK), and outliers like Turkey and Israel. This makes consensus more complex than in more homogenous groups like the EEG.
*   **Clear "Climate Action" vs. "Geographic Bridge" Framing:** The two bids present a stark choice: one focused on amplifying the voices of the most climate-vulnerable (Australia/Pacific) and one focused on geographic convenience and inclusion of a major emerging economy (Turkey).

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Starting from a base rate of a two-horse race, a reasonable prior would be slightly in Australia's favor due to the stronger narrative (Australia 55% / Turkey 40% / Germany & Other 5%), with low confidence (equivalent n≈10).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑ Large) Australia's Sep-Oct 2025 announcements of a 62-70% 2035 NDC and detailed Net Zero plan provide powerful, recent evidence of its commitment.
    *   (↑ Moderate) The co-hosting partnership with Pacific nations creates a compelling climate justice narrative that is likely to garner broad support.
    *   (↓ Small for Turkey) Potential for geopolitical friction with some EU members and Israel within WEOG could complicate Turkey's path to consensus.
    *   (↔ Neutral/↓ Small for Turkey) Lack of recent, high-profile climate policy announcements from Turkey to counter Australia's push.
*   **Net effect:** The recent, strong, and positive evidence for Australia's bid significantly outweighs other factors. The posterior for Australia should move up substantially, making it the clear favorite.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators (for Australia):**
    *   Public statements of support from major WEOG players (e.g., US, Canada, Germany, France).
    *   Joint statements from Australia and the Pacific Islands Forum reinforcing the unified bid.
    *   Reports of Turkey seeking to host a future COP instead (e.g., COP36), indicating a deal.
    *   Positive coverage in climate-focused international media about Australia's renewed ambition.
*   **DOWN indicators (for Australia):**
    *   A major WEOG country or bloc publicly endorsing Turkey.
    *   Reports of a deadlock within WEOG, increasing the (still small) chance of a Bonn default.
    *   Any significant domestic political event in Australia that casts doubt on its climate commitments.
    *   Emergence of a surprise compromise candidate from within WEOG.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Opaqueness of Decision:** The consensus process happens in closed-door diplomatic negotiations. Public signals may not reflect the private reality.
*   **Geopolitical Shocks:** A sudden international crisis involving Turkey or Australia could rapidly shift alliances and priorities within WEOG.
*   **Horse-Trading

To forecast which country will host COP 31 in 2026, we need to evaluate the probabilities for each option using Bayesian reasoning. Here's the step-by-step analysis:

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

- **Australia**: Given the historical precedent of contested COP host bids within a regional group, the base rate for either Australia or Turkey winning is roughly 40-50%. However, Australia's bid has a strong narrative advantage by partnering with Pacific Island Nations, which is a unique and politically savvy model. Therefore, I will start with a slightly higher base rate for Australia at 45%.

- **Turkey**: Turkey is the only other country in the WEOG group to officially put forward a bid. Given the same historical precedent, the base rate for Turkey is also around 40-50%. However, Turkey faces geopolitical headwinds and lacks recent, high-profile climate policy announcements compared to Australia. Therefore, I will start with a base rate of 35% for Turkey.

- **Germany (Bonn)**: The default host scenario is historically very rare, as it represents a significant diplomatic failure for the regional group. The base rate for this outcome is very low, likely <10%. I will start with a base rate of 5% for Germany.

- **Another Pacific Island Nation**: While Australia is proposing to co-host with Pacific Island Nations, the bid is primarily led by Australia. Therefore, the probability of another Pacific Island Nation independently hosting is very low. I will start with a base rate of 5%.

- **Other**: The probability of another country within the WEOG group emerging as a host is low, given the current bids. I will start with a base rate of 10%.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

- **Australia**: Australia's recent announcements of ambitious climate policies and its partnership with Pacific Island Nations strengthen its bid, making it more likely than the base case.

- **Turkey**: Turkey's geopolitical challenges and lack of recent climate policy announcements make it less likely than the base case.

- **Germany (Bonn)**: The likelihood of defaulting to Bonn remains low, consistent with the base case.

- **Another Pacific Island Nation**: The likelihood remains low, consistent with the base case.

- **Other**: The likelihood remains low, consistent with the base case.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

- **Australia**: The recent, strong, and positive evidence for Australia's bid, such as the ambitious 2035 NDC and detailed Net Zero plan, significantly increases the likelihood of Australia hosting.

- **Turkey**: The lack of recent, high-profile climate policy announcements and potential geopolitical friction decrease the likelihood of Turkey hosting.

- **Germany (Bonn)**: The historical rarity of defaulting to Bonn keeps the likelihood low.

- **Another Pacific Island Nation**: The likelihood remains low due to the nature of the bid being led by Australia.

- **Other**: The likelihood remains low due to the lack of other bids.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

- **Australia**: Starting with a prior of 45%, the strong evidence increases the posterior probability significantly. Let's assume the likelihood ratio for Australia's evidence is 2:1, updating the probability to around 60%.

- **Turkey**: Starting with a prior of 35%, the lack of evidence decreases the posterior probability. Let's assume the likelihood ratio is 1:2, updating the probability to around 25%.

- **Germany (Bonn)**: The prior remains at 5% due to the lack of new evidence.

- **Another Pacific Island Nation**: The prior remains at 5% due to the lack of new evidence.

- **Other**: The prior remains at 10% due to the lack of new evidence.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

- Consider the possibility of geopolitical shifts or new bids emerging, but the current evidence strongly favors Australia.

### 6. Final Normalization

Ensure the probabilities sum to approximately 100%.

### 7. Output Format

Australia: 60%  
Turkey: 25%  
Germany: 5%  
Another Pacific Island Nation: 5%  
Other: 5%

# Forecasting COP 31 Host Country for 2026

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

Let me establish base rates for each option:

**Australia**: The WEOG group is scheduled to host, and Australia is one of two official bidders. In a two-bidder race within a regional group, each candidate typically has a ~40-50% chance. I'll start with 45% for Australia.

**Turkey**: As the other official bidder from WEOG, Turkey also deserves a similar base rate of 45%.

**Germany**: As the default option (Bonn) if consensus fails, Germany has a small but non-zero chance. Historically, defaulting to Bonn is rare as it represents diplomatic failure. Base rate: 8%.

**Another Pacific Island Nation**: While Australia is proposing co-hosting with Pacific nations, the primary host would still be Australia. The chance of a Pacific nation becoming the primary host instead is very low. Base rate: 1%.

**Other**: This covers any unexpected outcome (another WEOG country stepping in as a compromise). Base rate: 1%.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case**:
- This follows the established rotation system among UN regional groups
- The decision requires consensus within the regional group
- Both main candidates (Australia and Turkey) are developed nations with capacity to host

**Key differences**:
- Australia's bid involves a novel co-hosting arrangement with Pacific Island nations
- Australia has recently made significant climate policy announcements (Sep-Oct 2025)
- The WEOG group is particularly diverse politically compared to other regional groups
- The two bids present distinct narratives: climate vulnerability (Australia) vs. geographic bridge (Turkey)

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence for Australia**:
- Australia's recent ambitious 2035 NDC (62-70% reduction) announced in September 2025
  - P(E|H): Very high (~0.9) - This is exactly what we'd expect if Australia were seriously pursuing the bid
  - P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.4) - They might make climate announcements anyway, but the timing is suspicious
- Partnership with climate-vulnerable Pacific nations creates a compelling narrative
  - P(E|H): High (~0.8) - This strengthens their bid considerably
  - P(E|~H): Low (~0.2) - This specific arrangement would be unusual if not pursuing the bid
- Adelaide's designation and South Australia's funding commitments
  - P(E|H): High (~0.8) - Shows serious preparation
  - P(E|~H): Low (~0.3) - Significant resources committed specifically for this purpose

**Evidence for Turkey**:
- Official bid with Antalya as likely host city
  - P(E|H): High (~0.8) - Expected if Turkey is serious
  - P(E|~H): Low (~0.2) - Would not put forward a bid otherwise
- Lack of recent high-profile climate policy announcements
  - P(E|H): Low (~0.3) - Would expect more if they were aggressively pursuing the bid
  - P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.6) - Not surprising if they aren't the frontrunner

**Evidence for Germany/Bonn default**:
- No reports of serious deadlock in WEOG discussions
  - P(E|H): Very low (~0.1) - Would expect signs of conflict if heading toward default
  - P(E|~H): High (~0.8) - Expected if negotiations are proceeding normally

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Let's update on Australia's recent climate policy announcements:

Prior odds for Australia = 45/55 = 0.82
Likelihood ratio = 0.9/0.4 = 2.25
Posterior odds = 0.82 × 2.25 = 1.845
Posterior probability = 1.845/(1+1.845) = 0.648 or ~65%

Now updating on the Pacific partnership narrative:
Prior odds = 65/35 = 1.86
Likelihood ratio = 0.8/0.2 = 4
Posterior odds = 1.86 × 4 = 7.44
Posterior probability = 7.44/(1+7.44) = 0.88 or ~88%

This seems too high given uncertainties, so I'll adjust downward.

For Turkey, the lack of recent climate policy announcements:
Prior odds = 45/55 = 0.82
Likelihood ratio = 0.3/0.6 = 0.5
Posterior odds = 0.82 × 0.5 = 0.41
Posterior probability = 0.41/(1+0.41) = 0.29 or ~29%

For Germany, the lack of reported deadlock:
Prior odds = 8/92 = 0.087
Likelihood ratio = 0.1/0.8 = 0.125
Posterior odds = 0.087 × 0.125 = 0.011
Posterior probability = 0.011/(1+0.011) = 0.011 or ~1.1%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

Potential blind spots:
- I may be overweighting recent public announcements from Australia while underestimating behind-the-scenes diplomatic work by Turkey
- The consensus process is opaque, and Turkey may have secured support from key WEOG members
- I might be underestimating geopolitical factors that could favor Turkey (e.g., EU-Turkey relations)
- The "co-hosting" arrangement might be viewed skeptically by some WEOG members

Alternative scenario: Turkey could be seen as a strategic bridge between Europe and Asia/Middle East, offering a compelling geopolitical narrative. Turkey's bid might also be supported by countries seeking to balance Australia's close alignment with the US.

After considering these factors, I should reduce Australia's probability somewhat and increase Turkey's.

## 6. Final Normalization

Adjusting my probabilities based on all evidence and red-teaming:
- Australia: ~70%
- Turkey: ~25% 
- Germany: ~3%
- Another Pacific Island Nation: ~1%
- Other: ~1%

## 7. Final Forecast

Australia: 70%
Turkey: 25%
Germany: 3%
Another Pacific Island Nation: 1%
Other: 1%
(sum 100%)

```md

Here is my probabilistic forecast and reasoning.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

To establish a prior probability, I will use the reference class of "contested bids for a COP presidency within a UN regional group." The background states there are two official bids from the Western European and Others Group (WEOG): Australia and Turkey.

*   **Australia & Turkey:** In a simple two-candidate race, a starting point would be roughly 50/50. However, the background notes Australia's unique co-hosting proposal with Pacific nations, which provides a narrative advantage. Therefore, a slightly informed prior would favor Australia. I'll set the initial priors at **Australia 50%** and **Turkey 40%**.
*   **Germany:** This is the default option if consensus fails. The research report notes that this is a sign of diplomatic failure and is actively avoided, as seen in the recent COP29 decision. This makes it a rare outcome. I will assign a low prior of **5%**.
*   **Another Pacific Island Nation:** The bid is framed as Australia co-hosting *with* these nations, not a bid *by* one of them. The official host would almost certainly be Australia. This option is highly unlikely to be the formal resolution. I assign a prior of **1%**.
*   **Other:** This accounts for a surprise compromise candidate emerging if Australia and Turkey deadlock, similar to how Azerbaijan was chosen for COP29. Given the two-candidate nature of this race, it's less likely than in a multi-candidate deadlock, but still possible. I assign a prior of **4%**.

This gives a full prior distribution: Australia (50%), Turkey (40%), Germany (5%), Other (4%), Another Pacific Island Nation (1%).

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities:** The process is standard for COP hosting decisions: it's a political negotiation requiring consensus within the designated regional group. Geopolitical relationships and diplomatic capital are key.
*   **Differences:**
    1.  **WEOG's Diversity:** WEOG is a uniquely diverse group, including the EU bloc, the CANZUK/US Anglosphere, and outliers like Turkey and Israel. This makes consensus potentially more complex than in more homogenous groups.
    2.  **Australia's Co-Host Model:** The partnership with climate-vulnerable Pacific nations is a novel and politically powerful framing not typical of past bids.
    3.  **Strategic Policy Action:** The research report highlights that Australia has undertaken very recent, significant climate policy actions seemingly timed to bolster its bid, which is a key differentiating factor.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will evaluate the key pieces of evidence from the research report.

*   **Evidence (E1): Australia's ambitious new 2035 NDC (62-70% reduction) and detailed Net Zero plan, announced in September/October 2025.**
    *   **Likelihood Assessment:** The probability of seeing such a major, strategically timed policy announcement is very high if Australia is making a serious, winning push for the presidency (P(E1 | Australia Wins) is high). It is much lower if their bid was not the frontrunner or was losing momentum (P(E1 | Australia Loses) is low). This evidence has a **very high likelihood ratio favoring Australia**. It directly counters Australia's primary historical weakness: its reputation as a climate laggard.

*   **Evidence (E2): Turkey's potential geopolitical friction with some EU members within WEOG.**
    *   **Likelihood Assessment:** Achieving consensus is the core requirement. The existence of friction with key member states makes consensus for Turkey less likely. Therefore, this evidence has a **moderate likelihood ratio against Turkey**.

*   **Evidence (E3): Lack of recent, high-profile climate policy announcements from Turkey to counter Australia's push.**
    *   **Likelihood Assessment:** In a competitive diplomatic contest, one would expect both sides to be actively campaigning. The absence of a major counter-move from Turkey is evidence that its bid may have less momentum or political capital. This has a **moderate likelihood ratio against Turkey**.

*   **Evidence (E4): The COP29 precedent, where a deadlock was resolved with a compromise rather than defaulting to Bonn.**
    *   **Likelihood Assessment:** This shows a strong preference within the UNFCCC system to avoid the default option. The probability of seeing this precedent is very high if the default (Germany) does not happen, and very low if it does. This evidence has a **strong likelihood ratio against Germany**.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

I will now update my priors based on the evidence.

*   **Prior odds for Australia vs. The Field:** 50% / 50% = 1.0
*   **Key Update Step:** The most significant evidence is Australia's new NDC (E1). This is a "game-changer" piece of information. A conservative estimate for the likelihood ratio might be 4:1 in favor of Australia.
    *   *Posterior Odds = Prior Odds × Likelihood Ratio* = 1.0 × 4.0 = 4.0
    *   *Posterior Probability = Odds / (1 + Odds)* = 4.0 / 5.0 = 80%
*   **Qualitative Adjustments:**
    *   The evidence against Turkey (E2, E3) significantly reduces its probability. The probability mass gained by Australia comes primarily from Turkey's share.
    *   The evidence against the Bonn default (E4) pushes Germany's already low probability even lower.
    *   The "Other" and "Another Pacific Island Nation" options are largely unaffected by the new evidence and remain small tail risks.

After considering all evidence, Australia's probability increases substantially, making it the clear frontrunner. Turkey's probability decreases significantly. Germany's probability also decreases.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My forecast is heavily reliant on the reported new climate policy from Australia. Is this overconfidence?
*   **Alternative Scenario:** The decision could be a pure geopolitical trade-off. European nations in WEOG might prioritize a geographically closer and logistically simpler COP in Turkey, regardless of Australia's new climate targets. They might form a blocking coalition against Australia, leading to a deadlock.
*   **Plausibility:** This is plausible. However, the narrative power of Australia's bid (partnering with the most vulnerable) combined with concrete, ambitious policy action provides strong political cover for countries to support it. Blocking such a bid would be diplomatically costly.
*   **Compromise Candidate:** If a deadlock does occur, the chance of an "Other" candidate (e.g., a neutral European nation like Switzerland) increases. The COP29 precedent supports this possibility.
*   **Adjustment:** I believe my high confidence in Australia is warranted by the strength of the evidence provided. However, I will retain a meaningful probability for Turkey (capturing the geopolitical alternative) and "Other" (capturing the deadlock/compromise scenario) to account for the closed-door nature of these negotiations. My current allocation of ~20% to non-Australian outcomes seems a reasonable hedge against this uncertainty.

### 6. Final Normalization

I will now finalize the probabilities, ensuring they sum to 100%.

*   **Australia:** Starts at 50%, strong positive evidence pushes it to the clear favorite. I will set it at **78%**.
*   **Turkey:** Starts at 40%, negative evidence and Australia's surge significantly reduce its chances. I will set it at **15%**.
*   **Germany:** Starts at 5%, the evidence against the default scenario pushes this down. I will set it at **3%**.
*   **Other:** Starts at 4%, the possibility of a compromise candidate in a deadlock keeps this as a small but relevant tail risk. I will set it at **3%**.
*   **Another Pacific Island Nation:** Starts at 1%, no new evidence supports this. It remains a very remote possibility. I will set it at **1%**.

The sum is 78 + 15 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 100%. The distribution reflects a strong favorite with a clear but distant challenger and several small tail risks.

Australia: 78%
Turkey: 15%
Germany: 3%
Another Pacific Island Nation: 1%
Other: 3%
