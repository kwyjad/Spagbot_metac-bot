Here is my research plan:

1.  **Identify Core Questions:**
    *   **Virginia Analysis:** What is the base rate for the party not holding the presidency to win the Virginia governorship? How strong is this "rule"? What are the specific strengths and weaknesses of Abigail Spanberger (D) and Winsome Earle-Sears (R)? Does recent polling and the political environment confirm or contradict the historical base rate?
    *   **New Jersey Analysis:** What is the base rate for a Democratic win in a New Jersey gubernatorial election? How does Jack Ciattarelli's (R) near-win in 2021 affect this base rate? What are the profiles of Mikie Sherrill (D) and Ciattarelli? How is the national political environment (specifically, the influence of a Republican president) expected to impact this blue-leaning state's election?
    *   **Combined Outcome Analysis:** Are the factors driving the two races correlated (e.g., national mood) or independent? How do the individual probabilities for each race combine to inform the likelihood of the four multiple-choice options (Both, Only VA, Only NJ, Neither)?

2.  **Propose Search Queries (Internal to Provided Sources):**
    *   I will "query" the provided sources for specific data points.
    *   `Virginia governor election history opposite party president` (from background)
    *   `Spanberger profile` and `Earle-Sears profile` (from Wikipedia sources)
    *   `Ciattarelli 2021 election performance` (from Wikipedia and NJ.com sources)
    *   `Sherrill profile` (from Wikipedia source)
    *   `Trump influence New Jersey governor race 2025` (from CBS and Guardian sources)
    *   `Polling data 2025 Virginia governor` and `Polling data 2025 New Jersey governor` (from background)

3.  **Synthesize Key Findings:**
    *   **Virginia:** The historical pattern of electing a governor from the party opposite the sitting U.S. President is exceptionally strong. Assuming a Republican is in the White House in 2025, this creates a powerful tailwind for Democrat Abigail Spanberger. Spanberger's profile as a former CIA officer and moderate congresswoman is well-suited to Virginia's suburban voters. Her opponent, Winsome Earle-Sears, is the incumbent Lieutenant Governor and a proven statewide winner from 2021, making her a formidable candidate who cannot be easily dismissed. However, the historical trend and polling data point strongly toward a Democratic victory.
    *   **New Jersey:** While a blue state in federal elections, NJ has a history of competitive gubernatorial races and has elected Republican governors. The 2021 election, where Jack Ciattarelli lost to the incumbent Democrat by only ~3 points, is a critical data point demonstrating his strength as a candidate and the state's willingness to consider a Republican governor. Democrat Mikie Sherrill, like Spanberger, has a strong profile (former Navy pilot, prosecutor). The key dynamic, highlighted in the sources, is the national environment. A Republican presidency creates a headwind for Ciattarelli, and Sherrill's strategy is to tie him to the national party and Trump. This nationalization likely benefits the Democrat in a blue state. Polling also favors Sherrill.
    *   **Conclusion:** The case for a Democratic win in Virginia is very strong due to the historical pattern. The case in New Jersey is also strong, but less certain due to Ciattarelli's proven electoral performance. The most probable outcome is the Democrats winning both races, with "Only Virginia" being the next most likely scenario.

4.  **Draft the Comprehensive Answer:** I will now assemble these synthesized findings into the required brief format.

### Reference class & base rates
*   **Virginia Gubernatorial Elections vs. Presidential Party (1977-2021):** This is the most relevant reference class. In 11 of the last 12 Virginia gubernatorial elections, the party that did *not* hold the presidency won. This establishes a powerful base rate of ~92% for the "out" party (the Democrats in 2025) to win. This is one of the strongest and most discussed trends in modern American politics.
*   **New Jersey Gubernatorial Elections (Post-2000):** In the six elections since 2001, Democrats have won four times (2001, 2005, 2017, 2021) and Republicans twice (2009, 2013). This suggests a base rate of ~67% for a Democratic victory. However, the 2021 election was extremely close (51.2% to 48.0%), indicating high variance and competitiveness despite the state's blue lean.
*   **Off-Year Elections as Presidential Referendum:** Off-year elections are often nationalized and serve as an early referendum on the sitting president. The president's party typically suffers losses. With a Republican assumed to be in the White House, this dynamic provides a tailwind for Democratic candidates in both states.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   [2025-11-01] The Guardian reports that Trump's policies are a major factor in the NJ race. — ↑ (for Both/Only NJ) — Nationalizing the race in a blue state like New Jersey likely helps the Democratic candidate, Sherrill, by mobilizing the base and appealing to moderate anti-Trump voters.
*   [2025-10-31] CBS News details Sherrill's strategy of linking Ciattarelli to Trump. — ↑ (for Both/Only NJ) — This reinforces the nationalization of the race, a strategy that is typically effective for the "out" party in a state that leans away from the president's party.
*   [2025-10-XX] Background information notes that polling in both states shows the Democratic candidates with a lead. — ↑ (for Both) — With the election just days away, late polling is a highly significant indicator, suggesting momentum is with the Democrats in both contests.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **Virginia's Anti-Presidential Party Trend:** (Large) A deeply ingrained historical pattern of voters using the gubernatorial election to check the power of the party in the White House. This is the single most powerful driver in the Virginia race.
*   **National Political Environment (Presidential Referendum):** (Large) A Republican presidency creates a favorable environment for Democrats, boosting their turnout and persuading swing voters. This affects both races.
*   **Ciattarelli's Proven Competitiveness:** (Moderate) Jack Ciattarelli's narrow 3.2-point loss in 2021 demonstrates he has a coalition and name recognition that significantly outperforms a generic Republican in New Jersey. This is a strong force pushing against a simple "blue state" forecast for NJ.
*   **Candidate Profiles:** (Small) Both Democratic candidates (Spanberger, Sherrill) are former federal officials with national security backgrounds, profiles that play well in suburban districts crucial to statewide victory. The GOP candidates are also strong (incumbent LG, prior near-winner), making this a largely balanced, but high-quality, field.
*   **Campaign Nationalization Strategy:** (Moderate) The Democratic strategy, especially in New Jersey, to tie the Republican candidates to the national party and Donald Trump is a key mechanism to leverage the national environment.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **VA: Stronger-than-usual Incumbency Factor:** The base rate often involves a challenger vs. an open seat. Here, the Republican candidate, Winsome Earle-Sears, is the sitting Lieutenant Governor, giving her higher name recognition and a record of statewide victory than a typical challenger.
*   **NJ: A Repeat, High-Performance Challenger:** Unlike a generic election, the NJ race features the same GOP challenger who dramatically over-performed in 2021. This makes the "generic blue state" base rate less applicable; the race is conditioned on a specific, proven candidate.
*   **NJ: Flipped National Environment:** The 2021 NJ race occurred with a Democrat in the White House, which likely aided Ciattarelli.

To forecast the outcomes of the 2025 Virginia and New Jersey gubernatorial elections, we will use Bayesian reasoning, considering historical trends, current polling data, and the political environment.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

- **Virginia**: Historically, Virginia has elected a governor from the party opposite the sitting U.S. President in 11 of the last 12 elections. This gives a base rate of approximately 92% for the "out" party, which would be the Democrats if a Republican is in the White House.
  
- **New Jersey**: In the last six gubernatorial elections, Democrats have won four times, suggesting a base rate of about 67% for a Democratic victory. However, the close 2021 election indicates significant competitiveness.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

- **Virginia**: The current situation aligns well with the historical trend, as the Democratic candidate, Abigail Spanberger, is leading in the polls. The presence of a Republican presidency further supports the base rate.

- **New Jersey**: While the state leans Democratic, Jack Ciattarelli's strong performance in 2021 suggests a more competitive race than the base rate might imply. However, the Democratic candidate, Mikie Sherrill, is also leading in the polls, and the national political environment favors Democrats.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

- **Virginia**: The likelihood of Spanberger winning given the historical trend and current polling is high. The evidence supports the base rate scenario.

- **New Jersey**: The likelihood of Sherrill winning is bolstered by her lead in the polls and the strategy of linking Ciattarelli to Trump, which is likely effective in a blue-leaning state.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

- **Virginia**: Starting with a prior of 92% for a Democratic win, the strong polling data and historical trend reinforce this, keeping the posterior probability high.

- **New Jersey**: Starting with a prior of 67%, the polling data and nationalization strategy increase the likelihood of a Democratic win, raising the posterior probability.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

- **Virginia**: Consider the possibility of overconfidence in the historical trend. Winsome Earle-Sears is a strong candidate with statewide recognition.

- **New Jersey**: Ciattarelli's competitiveness and the state's history of electing Republican governors suggest a non-negligible chance of a Republican win.

### 6. Final Normalization

Given the evidence and analysis, the probabilities are adjusted to reflect the most likely outcomes:

- **Both elections**: High probability due to strong Democratic leads in both states.
- **Only Virginia**: Less likely but possible if New Jersey's competitiveness leads to a Republican win.
- **Only New Jersey**: Least likely given Virginia's strong historical trend.
- **Neither election**: Very unlikely given current polling and historical trends.

### 7. Output Format

Both elections: 60%  
Only Virginia: 25%  
Only New Jersey: 5%  
Neither election: 10%  

These probabilities reflect the current evidence and historical trends, with adjustments for potential overconfidence and competitiveness in New Jersey.

# Forecasting the 2025 Virginia and New Jersey Gubernatorial Elections

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

**Virginia:**
- Historical base rate: In 11 of the last 12 Virginia gubernatorial elections (92%), the party opposite the White House has won.
- Assuming a Republican president in 2025, this gives Democrats a strong prior of ~92%.
- This pattern is remarkably consistent and widely recognized as one of the strongest trends in American state politics.

**New Jersey:**
- Since 2000, Democrats have won 4 of 6 gubernatorial elections (67%).
- However, the 2021 race was extremely close (51.2% to 48.0%), showing the state's competitiveness.
- Base rate for Democratic win: ~67%.

**Combined outcomes prior probabilities:**
- Both Democratic wins: 0.92 × 0.67 = 61.6%
- Only Virginia (D): 0.92 × 0.33 = 30.4% 
- Only New Jersey (D): 0.08 × 0.67 = 5.4%
- Neither (both R): 0.08 × 0.33 = 2.6%

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate:**
- Virginia's pattern of electing governors from the party opposite the presidency remains relevant.
- New Jersey continues to lean Democratic but remains competitive in state races.
- Off-year elections typically function as a referendum on the sitting president.

**Differences from base rate:**
- Virginia: Republican candidate Winsome Earle-Sears is the incumbent Lieutenant Governor, giving her higher name recognition than typical challengers.
- New Jersey: Jack Ciattarelli is a repeat candidate who nearly won in 2021, making him stronger than a generic Republican.
- New Jersey: The 2021 race had a Democratic president, which likely helped Ciattarelli. In 2025, a Republican presidency creates a different dynamic.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence for Virginia:**
- Polling shows Spanberger leading (P(E|Dem wins) = high, P(E|Dem loses) = low)
- Historical pattern strongly favors the out-party (P(E|Dem wins) = very high, P(E|Dem loses) = very low)
- Spanberger's moderate profile fits Virginia's electorate (P(E|Dem wins) = moderate, P(E|Dem loses) = moderate)

**Evidence for New Jersey:**
- Polling shows Sherrill leading (P(E|Dem wins) = high, P(E|Dem loses) = low)
- Ciattarelli's strong 2021 performance (P(E|Dem wins) = moderate, P(E|Dem loses) = high)
- Sherrill's strategy of nationalizing the race in a blue state (P(E|Dem wins) = high, P(E|Dem loses) = low)

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

**Virginia Update:**
Starting with prior of 92% for Democratic win:
- Update on polling evidence: The likelihood ratio strongly favors Democratic win
  - Prior odds: 92:8 = 11.5:1
  - Likelihood ratio: ~3:1 (polling shows clear lead)
  - Posterior odds: ~34.5:1
  - Posterior probability: 34.5/(34.5+1) ≈ 97%
- Adjusting for Earle-Sears' incumbency advantage (small negative update)
  - Final posterior: ~95% for Democratic win

**New Jersey Update:**
Starting with prior of 67% for Democratic win:
- Update on Ciattarelli's 2021 performance:
  - Prior odds: 67:33 = 2.03:1
  - Likelihood ratio: ~0.7:1 (favors Republican slightly)
  - Posterior odds: ~1.42:1
  - Posterior probability: 1.42/(1.42+1) ≈ 59%
- Update on polling and nationalization strategy:
  - Likelihood ratio: ~2:1 (favors Democrat)
  - New posterior odds: ~2.84:1
  - Final posterior: 2.84/(2.84+1) ≈ 74% for Democratic win

**Combined outcomes posterior probabilities:**
- Both Democratic wins: 0.95 × 0.74 = 70.3%
- Only Virginia (D): 0.95 × 0.26 = 24.7%
- Only New Jersey (D): 0.05 × 0.74 = 3.7%
- Neither (both R): 0.05 × 0.26 = 1.3%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- Late campaign developments not captured in the background information could shift dynamics.
- Polling errors could be correlated across both states if there's a systematic bias.
- Turnout in off-year elections is unpredictable and can produce surprising results.

**Alternative scenarios:**
- Virginia's historical pattern could break if national polarization overrides state-level trends.
- New Jersey's race could tighten if Ciattarelli successfully distances himself from national Republicans.

**Adjustments:**
- Slightly reduce confidence in Virginia to account for potential pattern-breaking.
- Slightly increase uncertainty in New Jersey given Ciattarelli's proven competitiveness.

## 6. Final Normalization

After red-teaming and final adjustments:
- Both Democratic wins: 68%
- Only Virginia (D): 25%
- Only New Jersey (D): 5%
- Neither (both R): 2%

Sum: 100%

## 7. Final Forecast

Both elections: 68%  
Only Virginia: 25%  
Only New Jersey: 5%  
Neither election: 2%  
(sum 100%)

Here is my probabilistic forecast.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

To establish a prior, I will analyze the two races separately and then combine them. The analysis assumes a Republican is in the White House in November 2025, as implied by the background context.

*   **Virginia:** The most relevant base rate is the historical trend of Virginia electing a governor from the party opposite the sitting U.S. President. Since 1977, this has occurred in 11 of 12 elections. This establishes a powerful base rate (prior) of **P(Democrat wins VA) ≈ 92%**.
*   **New Jersey:** New Jersey is a blue-leaning state but has a history of competitive gubernatorial races. In the six elections since 2001, Democrats have won four times. This suggests a base rate of **P(Democrat wins NJ) ≈ 67%**.

Assuming independence for the initial prior, the probabilities for the four options are:
*   P(Both) = P(VA_D) * P(NJ_D) = 0.92 * 0.67 ≈ 61.6%
*   P(Only VA) = P(VA_D) * P(NJ_R) = 0.92 * 0.33 ≈ 30.4%
*   P(Only NJ) = P(VA_R) * P(NJ_D) = 0.08 * 0.67 ≈ 5.4%
*   P(Neither) = P(VA_R) * P(NJ_R) = 0.08 * 0.33 ≈ 2.6%

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities:** Both races are open-seat, off-year gubernatorial elections. The national political environment, with a Republican president, creates a favorable tailwind for the Democratic candidates in both states, aligning with the general dynamic of off-year elections serving as a referendum on the president.
*   **Differences:** The candidates are not generic. In Virginia, the Republican candidate, Winsome Earle-Sears, is the incumbent Lieutenant Governor, giving her a higher profile and a record of statewide victory than a typical challenger. In New Jersey, Republican Jack Ciattarelli is also an unusually strong candidate, having lost the 2021 election by a very narrow margin (~3 points). This suggests the New Jersey race may be more competitive than the base rate implies.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

*   **Evidence 1: The "Virginia Rule" (Strongly favors Democrats in VA).** This is the single most powerful piece of evidence. The likelihood of a Democratic win in Virginia, given this historical pattern and a Republican president, is very high. This strongly supports the "Both" and "Only Virginia" options.
*   **Evidence 2: Jack Ciattarelli's strong 2021 performance (Favors Republicans in NJ).** Ciattarelli's near-win in 2021 is strong evidence of his specific appeal and ability to run a competitive race in New Jersey. P(Ciattarelli is the candidate | NJ race is close) is much higher than P(Ciattarelli is the candidate | NJ race is a Dem blowout). This evidence tempers the base rate and pulls probability away from "Both" and "Only NJ" towards "Only Virginia" and "Neither".
*   **Evidence 3: National Environment (Favors Democrats in both states).** The 2021 NJ race occurred with a Democrat in the White House, which likely helped Ciattarelli. The 2025 race will occur with a Republican president, flipping this dynamic in the Democrat's favor. This is a crucial piece of evidence that counteracts Ciattarelli's 2021 performance and pushes probabilities back towards a Democratic win in NJ.
*   **Evidence 4: Polling (Favors Democrats in both states).** The background states that the Democratic candidates are "up in the polls" in both states. This is direct, though potentially volatile, evidence that supports the "Both" option.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

Let's update the probability of a Democratic win in each state before combining them.

*   **Virginia:** The prior is ~92%. The Republican candidate, Earle-Sears, is strong, which might slightly reduce the probability. However, her 2021 win occurred with a Democratic president (a favorable environment for her party), and the powerful historical trend is now against her. The polling confirms the trend. I will adjust the probability of a Democratic win in Virginia slightly downwards from the base rate to account for candidate quality, but it remains very high. **P(Democrat wins VA) ≈ 85%**.
*   **New Jersey:** The prior is ~67%. Ciattarelli's proven strength pushes this down. However, the flipped national environment (from a D president in 2021 to an R president in 2025) is a major factor that pushes it strongly back up. The polling also favors the Democrat. The net effect is an upward revision from the base rate. **P(Democrat wins NJ) ≈ 75%**.

Now, combining these updated probabilities:
*   P(Both) = 0.85 * 0.75 = 63.75%
*   P(Only VA) = 0.85 * 0.25 = 21.25%
*   P(Only NJ) = 0.15 * 0.75 = 11.25%
*   P(Neither) = 0.15 * 0.25 = 3.75%

These races are not perfectly independent; the national mood is a correlated factor. A stronger-than-expected anti-GOP sentiment would help Democrats in both states, and vice-versa. This positive correlation means the joint outcomes ("Both" and "Neither") are slightly more likely than the independent calculation suggests. I will adjust by adding a few points to "Both" and "Neither" and subtracting from the mixed outcomes.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My forecast is heavily reliant on the "Virginia Rule" and the general effect of the national environment. What if these patterns break?
*   **Alternative Scenario:** A popular Republican president could buck the trend, or a major local issue or candidate scandal could dominate one or both races. Jack Ciattarelli proved he can make the NJ race extremely close even with an unfavorable presidential party; perhaps he can close the deal this time. Winsome Earle-Sears is an incumbent statewide officeholder. A GOP sweep ("Neither") is a non-trivial tail risk.
*   **Best Alternative Forecast:** The most plausible alternative is "Only Virginia." This occurs if the extremely strong Virginia trend holds, but Ciattarelli's proven strength as a candidate is enough to overcome the national headwind in New Jersey. My forecast assigns a ~19% chance to this, making it the clear second choice, which seems appropriate.
*   **Adjustment:** My initial updated probabilities (85% for VA, 75% for NJ) already incorporate significant uncertainty and are not overconfident. The final adjustment for correlation slightly increases the tail risk ("Neither" from 3.75% to 5%), which seems prudent.

### 6. Final Normalization

Based on the updated probabilities and adjustment for correlation:
*   **Both elections:** Start at 63.75%, adjust up for correlation. -> **66%**
*   **Only Virginia:** Start at 21.25%, adjust down. -> **19%**
*   **Only New Jersey:** Start at 11.25%, adjust down. -> **10%**
*   **Neither election:** Start at 3.75%, adjust up for correlation. -> **5%**
The sum is 66 + 19 + 10 + 5 = 100%. The ordering reflects that a Democratic win in Virginia is the most likely single event, and a win in New Jersey is also more likely than not.

Both elections: 66%
Only Virginia: 19%
Only New Jersey: 10%
Neither election: 5%
