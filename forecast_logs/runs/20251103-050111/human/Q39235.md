### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Post-Vaccine (2019-present) DRC Ebola Outbreaks:** This is the most relevant class. Since the approval and widespread availability of the rVSV-ZEBOV (Ervebo) vaccine, outbreaks have been contained more effectively. There have been at least five outbreaks in the DRC in this period (11th-15th).
    *   **Base Rate:** The median death toll for these outbreaks is extremely low, around 5 deaths. The range is from 1 to ~50 deaths, excluding the tail end of the massive Kivu outbreak which began before this period.
    *   **Reasoning:** This class best reflects the current technological and public health toolkit. The primary intervention, ring vaccination, is now standard procedure.
    *   **Limitations:** This class has few data points and does not include an outbreak that began with such a high initial case count in a logistically challenging region.

2.  **All DRC Ebola Outbreaks (1976-present):** This class includes all 16 known outbreaks in the DRC, providing a wider historical perspective.
    *   **Base Rate:** The distribution is highly skewed. The median number of deaths is approximately 40. However, the mean is much higher (~250) due to catastrophic outliers like the 1976 Yambuku (~280 deaths) and 2018-2020 Kivu (~2,280 deaths) epidemics.
    *   **Reasoning:** This class captures the full range of possibilities, including systemic failures that lead to large-scale events. It accounts for the inherent potential of the virus in a country with recurring structural challenges.
    *   **Limitations:** It is overly pessimistic as it gives equal weight to pre-vaccine, pre-therapeutics, and pre-modern surveillance eras.

3.  **Outbreaks with >10 Deaths in the First Week:** This class filters for outbreaks that showed signs of rapid initial transmission, potentially bypassing immediate containment.
    *   **Base Rate:** This is a small class of outbreaks, dominated by the major epidemics (e.g., West Africa 2014-16, DRC Kivu 2018-20). The median death toll is in the hundreds to low thousands.
    *   **Reasoning:** The current outbreak, with 15 deaths by day 3, fits this criterion. This reference class suggests we should be wary of anchoring on the small, quickly-contained outbreaks of the last few years.
    *   **Limitations:** This may be overly selective, as initial reports can be noisy. A cluster of cases in a single family or healthcare facility can produce a high initial number without guaranteeing wider community transmission.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-09-04** Outbreak declared in Kasaï Province, DRC. — ↑ — The start of the event; establishes the location and timeline.
*   **2025-09-07** Report of 32 cases and 15 deaths. — ↑ — A high initial number, suggesting transmission occurred for some time before detection and that the outbreak is already larger than several recent ones.
*   **2025-09-08** Health policy report highlights "infrastructure challenges" in Kasaï. — ↑ — Logistical difficulties in reaching the area could significantly slow down the deployment of vaccines, contact tracers, and treatment centers.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **Speed and Efficacy of Response (Large):** The single most important factor. A rapid deployment of vaccination teams, contact tracers, and mobile labs can contain the outbreak quickly. Delays due to infrastructure, security, or bureaucracy dramatically increase the potential scale.
*   **Vaccine Deployment and Uptake (Large):** The rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine is highly effective. The "ring vaccination" strategy (vaccinating contacts of known cases and contacts of contacts) is the primary tool for containment. The size of the outbreak will depend heavily on how quickly and comprehensively this can be implemented.
*   **Geographic Location & Infrastructure (Moderate-to-Large):** The outbreak is in Kasaï Province, noted for infrastructure challenges. This can impede the movement of personnel and supplies, making every aspect of the response slower and more expensive. It also makes it harder to trace contacts who may have traveled.
*   **Community Trust and Cooperation (Moderate):** Successful containment relies on the community reporting cases, identifying contacts, and accepting vaccination. Mistrust, misinformation, or hostility towards health workers (a major problem in the Kivu outbreak) can cripple response efforts.
*   **Health System Strain (Small-to-Moderate):** The DRC is simultaneously battling other epidemics (mpox, cholera, measles). This stretches the national health system's resources and personnel, potentially diverting attention and capacity from the Ebola response.
*   **Cross-border or Urban Spread (Large):** If the outbreak spreads from its rural origin to a major urban center (like Kananga) or across an international border, the number of contacts would explode, making containment exponentially more difficult.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **High Initial Velocity:** Compared to the post-vaccine base rate (Reference Class 1), this outbreak's initial reported size (32 cases/15 deaths) is an outlier. Most recent outbreaks were detected with only a handful of cases, allowing for immediate and effective ring vaccination.
*   **Challenging Logistics:** While the DRC always presents logistical challenges, the specific mention of "infrastructure challenges" in Kasaï suggests this may be worse than in recent outbreaks in the more accessible Equateur or North Kivu provinces. This contrasts with the assumption of a smooth, rapid response built into the optimistic post-vaccine base rate.
*   **Established Playbook Exists:** Unlike the pre-2018 era, there is now a robust, battle-tested international and national response plan for Ebola that incorporates vaccines and therapeutics. This is a major advantage compared to the historical base rate (Reference Class 2).
*   **Concurrent Health Crises:** The DRC's capacity is currently stretched by multiple other significant disease outbreaks. This was less of a compounding factor in some previous, smaller Ebola flare-ups.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A prior based on the post-vaccine DRC outbreaks (Reference Class 1) seems most appropriate. This suggests a log-normal distribution with a median around 20-50 deaths, with a weak "equivalent n" of ~5 to reflect the small number of data points in this class.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   **↑ (Large):** Initial case count (32) and death toll (15) are significantly higher than the entirety of most recent outbreaks.
    *   **↑ (Moderate):** Location in Kasaï with noted "infrastructure challenges" will likely slow the response.
    *   **↑ (Small):** National health system is strained by concurrent epidemics.
    *   **↓ (Large):** Existence and availability of highly effective vaccines and a standardized international response protocol.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly pushes the estimate up from the post-vaccine prior. The high initial velocity and logistical hurdles are significant negative signals. The posterior should shift substantially upward, likely into the 100-300 death range, while still acknowledging that the vaccine provides a strong ceiling against a Kivu-level catastrophe (2000+ deaths).

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Confirmed cases appearing in new, geographically distant health zones or a major city.
    *   Reports of attacks on healthcare workers or response teams.
    *   Official reports of vaccine or therapeutic stock shortages.
    *   A sustained high ratio of deaths-to-cases (>60%), suggesting poor access to care.
    *   Evidence of cross-border transmission (e.g., to Angola).
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   A consistent decline in the weekly number of new confirmed cases for 2-3 consecutive weeks.
    *   Reports from WHO/MSF confirming high vaccination coverage (>90%) in active transmission rings.
    *   The percentage of new cases arising from known, monitored contact lists approaches 100%.
    *   No new cases reported outside the initial outbreak zone within a 21-day period.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Information Lag:** Data from the DRC Ministry of Health can be delayed and subject to revision. The lack of updates since September 7 is a major source of uncertainty.
*   **Definitional Risk:** The resolution criteria depend on the DRC Ministry of Health's official tally. Political or administrative factors could influence how deaths are classified and reported.
*   **Hidden Spread:** The "infrastructure challenges" may mean surveillance is poor, and the true number of cases/deaths could be significantly higher than what is officially reported.
*   **Regime Change/Security Shock:** The security situation in the DRC is volatile. A sudden flare-up of conflict in the Kasaï region could halt the public health response entirely, leading to a worst-case scenario.
*   **Flare-up vs. New Introduction:** The provided sources note that some recent "outbreaks" were flare-ups from the 2018-2020 Kivu epidemic. While this is a new outbreak, understanding its origin (zoonotic spillover vs. persistent human transmission) could inform its dynamics.

**Final Research Summary:**
The outbreak's rapid start in a logistically difficult region points to a death toll that will substantially exceed the small, quickly-contained outbreaks of the last few years. However, the existence of effective vaccines and established response protocols makes a catastrophic, four-figure death toll highly unlikely before the January 2026 deadline.

To forecast the number of deaths from the new Ebola outbreak in the DRC before 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Reference Class 1: Post-Vaccine (2019-present) DRC Ebola Outbreaks**
  - **Median Death Toll:** ~5 deaths
  - **Range:** 1 to ~50 deaths
  - **Reasoning:** This class reflects the current technological and public health context, with vaccines and response protocols in place.
  - **Limitations:** Few data points and does not include outbreaks with high initial case counts in challenging regions.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarity:** The outbreak is in the post-vaccine era, with vaccines available.
- **Differences:** High initial case count (32 cases, 15 deaths) and infrastructure challenges in Kasaï Province, which could impede response efforts.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **High Initial Case Count:** Suggests a larger outbreak than typical post-vaccine cases. Increases likelihood of higher death toll.
- **Infrastructure Challenges:** Likely to slow response, increasing potential death toll.
- **Concurrent Health Crises:** Strains resources, potentially increasing death toll.
- **Vaccine Availability:** Strongly mitigates potential death toll, reducing likelihood of catastrophic outcomes.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
- **Prior:** Log-normal distribution with a median around 20-50 deaths.
- **Evidence Impact:**
  - **↑ (Large):** Initial case count and deaths.
  - **↑ (Moderate):** Infrastructure challenges.
  - **↓ (Large):** Vaccine availability.
- **Posterior Shift:** The evidence suggests a significant upward shift from the prior, likely into the 100-300 death range, while acknowledging the vaccine's mitigating effect.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** Consider potential for hidden spread or reporting delays.
- **Tail Risks:** Security issues or cross-border spread could lead to higher death tolls.
- **Alternative Forecast:** A scenario with rapid containment due to effective vaccine deployment could result in fewer deaths.
- **Adjustment:** Account for potential underreporting and infrastructure challenges by slightly widening the distribution.

# Forecasting Ebola Deaths in DRC Outbreak (2025-2026)

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll use a hybrid prior based on three reference classes:

**Primary Reference Class: Post-Vaccine DRC Ebola Outbreaks (2019-present)**
- Median deaths: ~5-10 deaths per outbreak
- Range: 1-50 deaths (excluding the tail end of Kivu outbreak)
- This reflects modern containment capabilities with vaccines

**Secondary Reference Class: All DRC Ebola Outbreaks (1976-present)**
- Median deaths: ~40
- Mean deaths: ~250 (skewed by major outbreaks like Kivu with ~2,280 deaths)
- Captures the full historical range of possibilities

**Tertiary Reference Class: Outbreaks with >10 Deaths in First Week**
- Median deaths: Hundreds to low thousands
- This class captures outbreaks with similar initial velocity to the current one

My prior distribution will be log-normal with a median of ~50 deaths and a 90% interval of approximately 10-500 deaths, giving more weight to the post-vaccine era but acknowledging this outbreak's unusually high initial case count.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate:**
- Same virus (Ebola) in the same country (DRC) with similar healthcare infrastructure
- Same vaccine and treatment protocols are available
- Similar international response mechanisms exist

**Key differences:**
- **Higher initial velocity**: 32 cases and 15 deaths by day 3 is significantly higher than most recent outbreaks, suggesting undetected transmission before official declaration
- **Geographic challenges**: Kasaï Province has noted "infrastructure challenges" that may impede response compared to other recent outbreaks
- **Multiple concurrent health crises**: DRC is simultaneously battling mpox, cholera, and measles, stretching resources
- **Timing advantage**: We have ~14 months until the resolution date (Jan 2026), giving substantial time for containment

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence pushing death toll higher:**
- Initial case count (32) and death toll (15) by day 3 suggests the outbreak was already substantial before detection (likelihood ratio ~3:1 for higher vs. lower outcomes)
- "Infrastructure challenges" in Kasaï will likely slow vaccine deployment and contact tracing (likelihood ratio ~2:1)
- Multiple concurrent epidemics straining DRC health system (likelihood ratio ~1.5:1)

**Evidence pushing death toll lower:**
- Proven effectiveness of rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine in ring vaccination strategy (likelihood ratio ~1:3 for higher vs. lower outcomes)
- Established international response protocols developed since 2014-2016 West Africa epidemic (likelihood ratio ~1:2)
- 14 months until resolution date provides ample time for containment (likelihood ratio ~1:1.5)

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with my prior centered at ~50 deaths (90% CI: 10-500), I'll update based on the most significant evidence:

**Update 1: High Initial Case Count**
- Prior: Median ~50 deaths
- Likelihood ratio: ~3:1 favoring higher outcomes
- Posterior: Median shifts to ~100-150 deaths

**Update 2: Infrastructure Challenges**
- Prior: Median ~100-150 deaths
- Likelihood ratio: ~2:1 favoring higher outcomes
- Posterior: Median shifts to ~150-200 deaths

**Update 3: Vaccine Effectiveness**
- Prior: Median ~150-200 deaths
- Likelihood ratio: ~1:3 favoring lower outcomes
- Posterior: Median shifts back to ~100-120 deaths

The posterior distribution is now centered around 100-120 deaths, with a wider 90% confidence interval of approximately 30-600 deaths. The distribution remains right-skewed, reflecting the small but real possibility of a much larger outbreak.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the possibility of spread to urban centers or across borders, which could dramatically increase the death toll
- The "infrastructure challenges" could be more severe than typical for DRC, potentially hampering response more than I've accounted for
- I might be overestimating vaccine deployment speed in a challenging region
- Political instability or security issues could emerge and disrupt response efforts

**Alternative forecast:**
A reasonable alternative forecast would center on 300-400 deaths, arguing that:
1. The high initial case count suggests widespread community transmission
2. Kasaï's infrastructure challenges will severely delay effective response
3. Historical patterns suggest outbreaks with high initial velocity often reach hundreds of deaths

**Rebuttal to alternative:**
While these concerns are valid, the effectiveness of modern Ebola response protocols and vaccines has been demonstrated repeatedly since 2019. Even outbreaks with challenging circumstances have been contained before reaching 100 deaths in the post-vaccine era.

**Tail risk adjustment:**
I'll widen my confidence intervals to account for the possibility of:
- Security breakdowns preventing response teams from accessing affected areas
- Spread to major urban centers or across borders
- Vaccine supply chain disruptions

Here is my probabilistic forecast.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most appropriate base rate is the set of Ebola outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) in the post-vaccine era (2019-present). This reference class consists of five outbreaks (the 11th through 15th) and reflects the current public health toolkit, including the highly effective rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine and established "ring vaccination" protocols.

This base rate distribution is highly skewed:
*   **Data points (deaths):** 55, 6, 6, 5, 1
*   **Median:** 6 deaths
*   **Mean:** 14.6 deaths
*   **Spread:** The range is small, with four outbreaks staying in the single digits and one reaching 55 deaths.

This prior suggests that a "typical" modern outbreak is small and quickly contained, but has a tail risk of growing into the mid-double digits. Due to the small sample size, this is a weak prior.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
**Similarities:**
*   The outbreak is in the DRC, where national and international health organizations have deep experience with Ebola.
*   The modern response toolkit (vaccines, therapeutics, contact tracing protocols) is available.

**Differences:**
*   **High Initial Velocity:** The outbreak has already caused 15 deaths as of September 7, only three days after its official declaration. This number is higher than the *total* death toll of four of the five outbreaks in the post-vaccine reference class. This strongly suggests a period of undetected community transmission occurred before the declaration, making this a fundamentally more dangerous starting position than a typical flare-up.
*   **Challenging Location:** The outbreak is in Kasaï Province, which is noted for "infrastructure challenges." This is a critical difference, as the speed and success of modern Ebola response are heavily dependent on logistics. Delays in deploying personnel, vaccines, and mobile labs can allow the virus to spread further, making containment exponentially harder.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
*   **Evidence 1: 15 deaths by day 3.** This evidence is highly inconsistent with a small, contained outbreak (final toll < 50) and very consistent with an outbreak that becomes large (final toll > 100). It dramatically increases the probability of a higher death toll. This is the strongest piece of evidence, pushing the forecast significantly upward.
*   **Evidence 2: Location in Kasaï with "infrastructure challenges".** This evidence acts as a risk multiplier. It makes a rapid, effective response less likely and a slow, difficult response more likely. This stretches the right tail of the distribution, increasing the probability of outcomes in the hundreds.
*   **Evidence 3: Existence of vaccines and modern response protocols.** This is a feature of the base case, but it's crucial evidence that caps the extreme upper tail. While the situation is serious, these tools make a catastrophic repeat of the 2014 West Africa (>11,000 deaths) or even the 2018 Kivu (>2,200 deaths) epidemics very unlikely, barring a "perfect storm" of compounding failures (e.g., intense armed conflict plus widespread community resistance).

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
*   **Prior:** A distribution with a median of ~10 deaths and a tail extending to ~60.
*   **Likelihoods:** The evidence (high initial toll, difficult location) strongly favors a much larger outbreak.
*   **Posterior:** The prior is overwhelmed by the evidence. The posterior distribution must be shifted significantly to the right.
    *   The lower bound is now effectively above 15. Given the likely number of existing infections, a final toll below 40 seems highly optimistic.
    *   The median (P50) moves from ~10 into the low hundreds. The pre-vaccine, large-scale DRC outbreaks (e.g., Kikwit 1995, ~250 deaths) become a relevant reference point for a "bad but not catastrophic" scenario. I place the new median around 130.
    *   The right tail is now much fatter, reflecting the increased risk of a prolonged, difficult-to-contain epidemic. However, it is still capped by the effectiveness of modern interventions, making a four-figure death toll a remote possibility rather than a central one.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
*   **Could the forecast be too high?** Yes, if the initial cluster of cases was a single, isolated superspreader event (e.g., a funeral) that has already been identified. In this case, a rapid ring vaccination could still contain the outbreak with a final toll under 100. My P10 and P20 values account for this possibility.
*   **Could the forecast be too low?** This is a greater risk. The combination of a fast-moving outbreak and poor infrastructure is dangerous. If the virus reaches a major urban center like Kananga, or if significant community resistance emerges, the death toll could easily surpass my P90. The Kivu outbreak demonstrated that even with vaccines, a breakdown in security and public trust can lead to a catastrophe. I have stretched the upper tail of my distribution (P80, P90) to reflect this significant tail risk, acknowledging that an outcome of 400-500 deaths, while not the most likely scenario, is plausible if the response falters.

### 6. Final Percentiles

P20: 65
P40: 100
P60: 160
P80: 280
P90: 450
