### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Supreme Court reviews cases of major executive action under broad statutory authority (Major Questions Doctrine cases):** This class includes cases where the executive branch uses a broad, often old, statute to enact a policy with vast economic and political significance that Congress has not specifically authorized. Recent examples include *West Virginia v. EPA* (Clean Power Plan) and *NFIB v. OSHA* (vaccine mandate).
    *   **Base Rate:** In the current Court (post-2020), the executive branch has lost nearly all of these cases. The base rate for the executive action being struck down is plausibly **70-90%**.
    *   **Reasoning:** The Roberts Court's conservative majority has actively developed and applied the Major Questions Doctrine, requiring clear congressional authorization for such transformative executive actions. This case fits the pattern perfectly.
    *   **Limitations:** This case involves foreign affairs and national security, areas where the Court traditionally grants the President more deference than in domestic policy.

2.  **Supreme Court reviews presidential action in foreign affairs/national security:** This class includes cases where the President's authority in foreign policy or national security is challenged. A key recent example is *Trump v. Hawaii* (travel ban).
    *   **Base Rate:** Historically, the President wins these cases. The base rate for the presidential action being upheld is plausibly **60-75%**.
    *   **Reasoning:** The Court is often reluctant to second-guess the President's judgment on threats emanating from abroad and tends to interpret statutory authority in this domain broadly.
    *   **Limitations:** This case's use of IEEPA for broad economic tariffs arguably blurs the line between foreign policy and domestic economic regulation, the latter being Congress's domain. The "threat" of a trade deficit is less traditional than terrorism or military threats.

3.  **Supreme Court reviews cases with unanimous agreement in lower appellate courts:** This class involves cases where the Supreme Court takes up an issue on which the lower courts that have ruled on the merits are in agreement.
    *   **Base Rate:** The Supreme Court reverses the lower court decision in a significant majority of the cases it chooses to hear (overall reversal rate is ~60-70%). However, when there is no "circuit split" and lower courts agree, the case for reversal is often weaker unless a novel, major constitutional issue is at stake. A plausible base rate for *affirming* the unanimous lower court position (i.e., ruling the tariffs unlawful) is **40-60%**.
    *   **Reasoning:** The Court grants certiorari to resolve important issues, not just to correct errors. Still, a consensus view from multiple federal judges below creates a strong presumption.
    *   **Limitations:** The lower court reasoning differed, and the Supreme Court may feel the issue is so important that it must weigh in regardless of lower court agreement, potentially with a novel rationale.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-05-28** Two separate federal courts (CIT, D.D.C.) rule tariffs unlawful on different grounds. ↓ (Strong signal against the government from multiple judicial bodies.)
*   **2025-08-29** The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirms the lower court, ruling the tariffs exceed IEEPA authority. ↓ (Appellate court confirmation strengthens the legal case against the tariffs.)
*   **2025-09-09** Supreme Court grants certiorari on an expedited schedule for both cases. ↑ for a 2025 ruling, ↓ for "Other ruling". (Signals the Court views the issue as urgent and nationally significant, making a procedural dodge less likely.)
*   **2025-10-28** PIIE analysis suggests no historical precedent for using IEEPA for tariffs, undermining a key potential government argument. ↓ (Weakens the government's case based on historical practice.)
*   **2025-11-02** Media coverage (WaPo, Guardian) frames the case as a major test of separation of powers and presidential authority. ↔ (Highlights the central legal conflict but doesn't favor an outcome; confirms the applicability of the "Major Questions" reference class.)

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Major Questions & Nondelegation Doctrines:** The Court's conservative majority is highly skeptical of broad executive power claims not explicitly granted by Congress. Imposing tariffs, a form of tax, is a quintessential legislative power. This is the challengers' strongest argument. (Large driver toward **Tariffs unlawful**).
2.  **Deference to Executive on National Security:** The government's case rests on framing the tariffs as a necessary response to national emergencies (drug trafficking, economic threats). The Court often defers to the President in this sphere. (Moderate driver toward **Tariffs lawful**).
3.  **Statutory Textualism:** The core dispute is whether IEEPA's grant of authority to "regulate" imports includes the power to set tariffs. Textualists on the Court may find that "regulate" does not unambiguously mean "tax," a power given to Congress in Article I. (Moderate driver toward **Tariffs unlawful**).
4.  **Availability of an "Off-Ramp" (Mixed Ruling):** The Court is reviewing two distinct tariff regimes: specific "trafficking tariffs" and broad "reciprocal tariffs." This allows the Court to split the difference, potentially upholding the more targeted tariffs (closer to a traditional national security emergency) while striking down the broader ones (closer to general economic policy). (Large driver toward **Mixed ruling**).
5.  **Judicial Restraint/Pragmatism:** A sweeping ruling in either direction would cause massive economic and political disruption. This might incline some justices (e.g., the Chief Justice) toward a narrow or mixed ruling that resolves the immediate case without setting a dramatic new precedent. (Moderate driver toward **Mixed ruling** or **Other ruling**).
6.  **Unanimity of Lower Courts:** The fact that the D.C. District Court, the Court of International Trade, and the Federal Circuit all found the tariffs unlawful (albeit for varied reasons) creates a strong current against the government's position. (Moderate driver toward **Tariffs unlawful**).

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Unprecedented Application of IEEPA:** Unlike past uses of emergency powers, this is the first time IEEPA has been used to impose broad-based tariffs, making historical analogies difficult and weakening claims of longstanding executive authority.
*   **Direct Clash of Constitutional Powers:** The case presents a stark conflict between the President's emergency powers and Congress's core constitutional authority over commerce and taxation, making it a purer separation-of-powers question than many prior cases.
*   **Dual Tariff Regimes:** The simultaneous challenge to two different types of tariffs (targeted anti-trafficking vs. general reciprocal) under the same statute is unusual and provides the Court a clear path to a split decision.
*   **Current Court's Philosophy:** This specific Court has a well-developed and muscular skepticism of the administrative state (*cf.* Major Questions Doctrine), making it uniquely hostile to the type of executive action at issue compared to courts in previous eras.
*   **Economic Scope:** The tariffs' sheer scale, affecting trade with nearly all partners, distinguishes this from more targeted sanctions or trade actions of the past, increasing the political and economic stakes of the Court's decision.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A plausible prior, blending the conflicting reference classes, would be centered on **Tariffs unlawful** (~45%) and **Mixed ruling** (~35%), with lower probabilities for **Tariffs lawful** (~15%) and other outcomes (~5%). This reflects the novelty of the action but acknowledges the possibility of deference. (Equivalent n ≈ 10).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   Unanimous lower court rulings against the tariffs: ↓ Large (reinforces the legal weakness of the government's position).
    *   The current Court's established skepticism of broad executive authority (Major Questions Doctrine): ↓ Large (this is the dominant judicial philosophy for the majority).
    *   The government's framing as a national security issue: ↑ Moderate (this is the government's most viable path to victory, playing on deference).
    *   The clear distinction between the two tariff types: ↑ Large for **Mixed ruling** (offers a pragmatic, compromise outcome).
    *   Lack of direct historical precedent for this use of IEEPA: ↓ Moderate (undercuts the government's claims of implicit authority).
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly reinforces the initial prior. The posterior should shift further away from **Tariffs lawful** and concentrate probability more heavily on **Tariffs unlawful** and **Mixed ruling**. The likelihood of a complete government victory appears very low.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators (favoring Lawful/Mixed):**
    *   Oral argument questions from conservative justices (e.g., Alito, Kavanaugh) focusing on the breadth of the statutory text ("any... regulation") and the President's unique role in foreign affairs.
    *   Justices expressing concern about the judiciary interfering with the President's ability to respond to perceived national emergencies.
    *   Questions that distinguish sharply between the trafficking tariffs (as a plausible emergency response) and the reciprocal tariffs (as economic policy).
    *   Any leaks or reports suggesting the Chief Justice is seeking a narrow, compromise opinion.

*   **DOWN indicators (favoring Unlawful):**
    *   Oral argument questions from conservative justices (e.g., Gorsuch, Thomas, Roberts) focusing on the nondelegation doctrine and Congress's exclusive power to tax.
    *   Questions pressing the Solicitor General for a "limiting principle" on the President's IEEPA power and receiving an unsatisfactory answer.
    *   Frequent citation by justices to cases like *West Virginia v. EPA* or *Schechter Poultry*.
    *   Minimal discussion of the specific threats (cartels, trade deficits) and extensive discussion of constitutional structure.

To forecast how the Supreme Court will rule on Trump's tariffs in 2025, we will follow the structured Bayesian reasoning process outlined.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

- **Tariffs lawful:** Base rate of 15%. This is based on the historical tendency of the Supreme Court to defer to the President in foreign affairs and national security cases, but tempered by the current Court's skepticism of broad executive power claims.
  
- **Tariffs unlawful:** Base rate of 45%. This reflects the Court's recent trend of striking down executive actions under the Major Questions Doctrine, especially when Congress's authority is implicated.

- **Mixed ruling:** Base rate of 35%. Given the dual nature of the tariffs (trafficking vs. reciprocal), the Court may choose a middle path, upholding some tariffs while striking down others.

- **Other ruling:** Base rate of 5%. This accounts for procedural outcomes where the Court does not rule on the merits.

- **No 2025 ruling:** Base rate of 0%. The expedited schedule and the Court's agreement to hear the case suggest a ruling will be made in 2025.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

- **Similarities:** The case involves broad executive action under a statute, fitting the Major Questions Doctrine pattern. The Court's conservative majority has shown skepticism towards such actions.

- **Differences:** The case involves foreign affairs and national security, areas where the Court traditionally grants more deference to the President.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

- **Unanimous lower court rulings against the tariffs:** Strong evidence against the tariffs being lawful. Likelihood of this evidence if tariffs are unlawful is high, while low if tariffs are lawful.

- **Current Court's skepticism of broad executive authority:** Strong evidence against tariffs being lawful. Likelihood is high if tariffs are unlawful, low if lawful.

- **Government's framing as a national security issue:** Moderate evidence for tariffs being lawful. Likelihood is moderate if tariffs are lawful, low if unlawful.

- **Dual nature of tariffs:** Strong evidence for a mixed ruling. Likelihood is high if mixed ruling, moderate if unlawful, low if lawful.

- **Lack of historical precedent for IEEPA use:** Moderate evidence against tariffs being lawful. Likelihood is moderate if tariffs are unlawful, low if lawful.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

- **Tariffs lawful:** Prior odds = 15/85. Evidence (unanimous lower court rulings, skepticism of broad authority) strongly against. Posterior odds decrease significantly.

- **Tariffs unlawful:** Prior odds = 45/55. Evidence (unanimous lower court rulings, skepticism of broad authority) strongly supports. Posterior odds increase.

- **Mixed ruling:** Prior odds = 35/65. Evidence (dual nature of tariffs) supports. Posterior odds increase moderately.

- **Other ruling:** Prior odds = 5/95. Evidence (expedited schedule) against. Posterior odds decrease.

- **No 2025 ruling:** Prior odds = 0/100. Evidence (expedited schedule) strongly against. Posterior odds remain negligible.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

- **Overconfidence check:** Consider the possibility of the Court deferring more than expected due to national security framing. Adjust probabilities slightly towards lawful and mixed outcomes.

- **Tail risks:** Consider procedural outcomes or unexpected deference due to foreign affairs context.

### 6. Final Normalization

Ensure probabilities sum to approximately 100% and reflect the evidence and reasoning.

### 7. Output Format

Tariffs lawful: 10%  
Tariffs unlawful: 50%  
Mixed ruling: 35%  
Other ruling: 5%  
No 2025 ruling: 0%  

These probabilities reflect the current evidence and reasoning, with a strong likelihood of the tariffs being ruled unlawful or a mixed ruling, given the Court's recent trends and the specifics of the case.

# Analysis of Supreme Court Ruling on Trump's Tariffs in 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll establish base rates for each option by examining relevant reference classes:

**Tariffs lawful:**
- In cases involving presidential authority in foreign affairs/national security, presidents historically win 60-75% of the time.
- However, this Court has been skeptical of broad executive power claims under the Major Questions Doctrine.
- Prior: 15% (This is unusually low for national security cases, but reflects this Court's skepticism of executive overreach)

**Tariffs unlawful:**
- In Major Questions Doctrine cases under the current Court, executive actions have been struck down 70-90% of the time.
- The lower courts unanimously ruled against the tariffs (though with different reasoning).
- Prior: 45% (This reflects the strong legal headwinds facing the government)

**Mixed ruling:**
- The Court often seeks compromise positions in politically charged cases.
- The presence of two distinct tariff regimes (trafficking vs. reciprocal) creates a natural splitting point.
- Prior: 35% (This reflects the Court's tendency toward narrower rulings when possible)

**Other ruling:**
- Procedural dismissals are rare in high-profile cases granted expedited review.
- Prior: 3% (Low probability given the Court's decision to expedite)

**No 2025 ruling:**
- The Court has already granted certiorari on an expedited schedule with argument in November 2025.
- Prior: 2% (Very unlikely given the expedited schedule)

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Like other Major Questions cases, this involves executive action with vast economic significance under a broadly worded statute.
- Like other national security cases, it involves presidential claims of emergency powers to address foreign threats.

**Key differences:**
- Unprecedented use of IEEPA for broad tariffs (no historical precedent)
- Direct clash between presidential emergency powers and Congress's explicit constitutional authority over taxation and commerce
- Dual tariff regimes (trafficking vs. reciprocal) with different justifications
- Unanimous lower court rulings against the government (though with different reasoning)
- Extraordinary economic impact affecting global trade relationships

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence 1: Unanimous lower court rulings against the tariffs**
- P(E|Tariffs lawful) = 0.2 (Unlikely that all lower courts would rule against a legally sound executive action)
- P(E|Tariffs unlawful) = 0.8 (Highly likely if the tariffs truly exceed statutory authority)
- P(E|Mixed ruling) = 0.5 (Moderate likelihood, as lower courts didn't clearly distinguish between tariff types)

**Evidence 2: Current Court's established skepticism of broad executive authority**
- P(E|Tariffs lawful) = 0.3 (This Court has consistently limited executive power under broad statutes)
- P(E|Tariffs unlawful) = 0.9 (This evidence strongly supports finding the tariffs unlawful)
- P(E|Mixed ruling) = 0.7 (This Court might still uphold narrower applications of emergency power)

**Evidence 3: National security framing by the government**
- P(E|Tariffs lawful) = 0.8 (This framing strongly supports the government's position)
- P(E|Tariffs unlawful) = 0.5 (Even with this framing, the Court may still find overreach)
- P(E|Mixed ruling) = 0.7 (This framing works better for trafficking tariffs than reciprocal tariffs)

**Evidence 4: Clear distinction between two tariff types**
- P(E|Tariffs lawful) = 0.3 (The distinction highlights the overreach of at least the reciprocal tariffs)
- P(E|Tariffs unlawful) = 0.4 (The distinction might lead the Court to split rather than invalidate all)
- P(E|Mixed ruling) = 0.9 (This distinction strongly supports a mixed ruling)

**Evidence 5: Lack of historical precedent for this use of IEEPA**
- P(E|Tariffs lawful) = 0.3 (Novel uses of statutory authority face higher scrutiny)
- P(E|Tariffs unlawful) = 0.8 (Lack of precedent strongly suggests Congress didn't intend this use)
- P(E|Mixed ruling) = 0.6 (The trafficking tariffs might be closer to traditional IEEPA uses)

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

Let's update based on Evidence 1 (unanimous lower court rulings):

For Tariffs lawful:
- Prior probability: 15%
- Likelihood ratio: 0.2/0.8 = 0.25
- Posterior odds: 0.15/0.85 × 0.25 = 0.044
- Posterior probability: 0.044/(1+0.044) ≈ 4.2%

For Tariffs unlawful:
- Prior probability: 45%
- Likelihood ratio: 0.8/0.2 = 4
- Posterior odds: 0.45/0.55 × 4 = 3.27
- Posterior probability: 3.27/(1+3.27) ≈ 76.6%

For Mixed ruling:
- Prior probability: 35%
- Likelihood ratio: 0.5/0.5 = 1
- Posterior odds: 0.35/0.65 × 1 = 0.538
- Posterior probability: 0.538/(1+0.538) ≈ 35%

After normalizing (and accounting for Other ruling and No 2025 ruling), we get:
- Tariffs lawful: ~3.5%
- Tariffs unlawful: ~64%
- Mixed ruling: ~29%
- Other ruling: ~2%
- No 2025 ruling: ~1.5%

Continuing with Evidence 2-5 (qualitatively):
- Evidence 2 (Court's skepticism of executive power) further reduces "Tariffs lawful" probability
- Evidence 3 (National security framing) slightly increases "Tariffs lawful" and "Mixed ruling"
- Evidence 4 (Distinction between tariff types) significantly increases "Mixed ruling" at the expense of both extreme outcomes
- Evidence 5 (Lack of precedent) further reduces "Tariffs lawful"

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the Court's deference to the President on national security matters
- The Court might be more willing to uphold the trafficking tariffs than I've estimated
- I might be overestimating the Court's willingness to strike down executive action in an area with foreign policy implications
- The Court could surprise with a procedural ruling that avoids the merits entirely

**Alternative scenarios:**
- The Court could uphold both tariff regimes on national security grounds, deferring to the President's judgment about threats
- The Court might find a narrow statutory interpretation that upholds the tariffs without expanding executive power
- The Court could issue a fractured decision with no clear majority, leading to an "Other ruling"

**Adjustments:**
- I should increase the probability of "Mixed ruling" given the natural splitting point between tariff types
- I should slightly increase "Tariffs lawful" to account for possible deference on national security
- I should slightly increase "Other ruling" to account for the possibility of a fractured Court

## 6. Final Normalization

After all updates and red team adjustments:

Tariffs lawful: 8%
Tariffs unlawful: 52%
Mixed ruling: 36%
Other ruling: 3%
No 2025 ruling: 1%
(sum = 100%)

## 7. Output Format

Tariffs lawful: 8%
Tariffs unlawful: 52%
Mixed ruling: 36%
Other ruling: 3%
No 2025 ruling: 1%
(sum = 100%)

This is a complex legal question that pits two major lines of Supreme Court jurisprudence against each other: the Court's traditional deference to the President in matters of national security and foreign affairs, and its more recent skepticism of broad executive actions taken under old statutes, known as the Major Questions Doctrine.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

To form a prior probability, I will blend three relevant reference classes:

1.  **Major Questions Doctrine (MQD) Cases:** This class involves the executive branch using a broad, often old, statute to enact policies with vast economic and political significance. The current Supreme Court has been very active in this area, consistently ruling against the executive. Recent examples include striking down the EPA's Clean Power Plan (*West Virginia v. EPA*) and OSHA's vaccine mandate (*NFIB v. OSHA*). The base rate for the executive action being struck down in such cases is very high, plausibly **75%**. This base rate strongly supports the "Tariffs unlawful" option.

2.  **Presidential Authority in Foreign Affairs/National Security:** Historically, the Court grants significant deference to the President in this domain. The government's entire legal justification rests on framing the tariffs as a response to national emergencies originating abroad. A key modern precedent is *Trump v. Hawaii* (the "travel ban" case), where the Court upheld the President's action. The base rate for the President's action being upheld in this class is plausibly **65%**. This base rate strongly supports the "Tariffs lawful" option.

3.  **Cases with Unanimous Lower Court Agreement:** The Supreme Court agrees to hear cases to resolve important legal questions, not just to correct errors. However, when multiple lower courts (here, the Court of International Trade, the D.C. District Court, and the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit) have all ruled the same way on the outcome, it creates a strong presumption against reversal. The base rate for the Supreme Court *affirming* a unanimous lower court judgment is significant, perhaps **50%**. This supports "Tariffs unlawful."

**Synthesized Prior:** The MQD and foreign affairs deference base rates point in opposite directions. However, the current Court's clear ideological project has been to rein in executive power via the MQD, suggesting this is the more powerful factor. The structure of the case, involving two distinct tariff regimes (trafficking-related and trade-deficit-related), also makes a split decision plausible from the outset. Therefore, I will set a prior that favors "Unlawful" but gives significant weight to a "Mixed ruling" and some weight to "Lawful."

*   P(Unlawful): 45%
*   P(Mixed): 30%
*   P(Lawful): 15%
*   P(Other/No Ruling): 10%

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

This case is unusual because it represents a direct collision between the two primary reference classes. Unlike a domestic environmental or health regulation (pure MQD), the tariffs are justified on national security grounds. But unlike a travel ban (pure foreign affairs), the tariffs are a form of tax and economic regulation—a power the Constitution explicitly grants to Congress. The "reciprocal tariffs" based on trade deficits, in particular, stretch the definition of a national security emergency into the realm of general economic policy, weakening the government's deference argument and strengthening the MQD argument.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will evaluate key pieces of evidence from the scenario:

*   **Evidence 1: Two distinct tariff regimes are being challenged.** The case involves both targeted "trafficking tariffs" and broad "reciprocal tariffs."
    *   This evidence significantly increases the likelihood of a **Mixed ruling**. It provides the Court a clear and logical way to "split the baby": uphold the tariffs more closely tied to a traditional national security threat (drug trafficking) while striking down those that look more like general economic policymaking. P(E1 | Mixed) is very high.

*   **Evidence 2: The government lost unanimously in the lower courts.** The CIT, DDC, and a 7-4 majority at the Federal Circuit all ruled the tariffs unlawful.
    *   This is strong evidence against the "Tariffs lawful" option. While the Supreme Court frequently reverses lower courts, a clean sweep for the challengers across multiple courts on different legal theories suggests the government's case is fundamentally weak. P(E2 | Lawful) is low. This evidence pushes probability toward **Tariffs unlawful** and **Mixed ruling**.

*   **Evidence 3: The Supreme Court granted review on an expedited schedule.** Oral arguments are set for early November 2025, with a decision expected before the end of the year.
    *   This is strong evidence against the **No 2025 ruling** and **Other ruling** options. Expedited review signals the Court sees the issue as urgent and intends to decide it on the merits promptly. P(E3 | No 2025 ruling) is very low.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

1.  **Start with Prior:** P(Unlawful)=45%, P(Mixed)=30%, P(Lawful)=15%, P(Other/No Ruling)=10%.
2.  **Apply Evidence 3 (Expedited Review):** This makes procedural outcomes highly unlikely. I will reduce the combined probability of "Other" and "No 2025 ruling" from 10% to 4% and redistribute the freed-up 6% proportionally to the merits outcomes.
    *   New distribution: P(Unlawful)≈48%, P(Mixed)≈32%, P(Lawful)≈16%, P(Other/No Ruling)=4%.
3.  **Apply Evidence 2 (Lower Court Losses):** This makes a complete government victory much less likely. I will significantly reduce the probability of "Tariffs lawful," moving that probability mass primarily to "Tariffs unlawful." Let's cut P(Lawful) by more than half, from 16% to 7%. I'll add the 9% primarily to "Unlawful" (+6%) and "Mixed" (+3%).
    *   New distribution: P(Unlawful)=54%, P(Mixed)=35%, P(Lawful)=7%, P(Other/No Ruling)=4%.
4.  **Apply Evidence 1 (Two Tariff Regimes):** This is the strongest argument for a compromise. A mixed ruling allows the Court to respect national security deference in a limited way while upholding Congressional power over the economy via the MQD. This is a classic "off-ramp" for a Court that may wish to avoid a maximalist ruling. I will shift significant probability from both "Unlawful" and "Lawful" to "Mixed."
    *   Final Posterior: I will shift probability from the all-or-nothing outcomes to the compromise outcome, making "Mixed ruling" the most likely option.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My analysis favors a "Mixed ruling" as a pragmatic compromise. The biggest risk to this forecast is that the Court's conservative majority opts for a "cleaner" legal principle. For instance, a majority of textualist/originalist justices might conclude that the IEEPA's power to "regulate" commerce simply does not include the power to impose tariffs (a tax), regardless of the emergency. This would lead to a full "Tariffs unlawful" ruling. Conversely, the Court could fully embrace the *Trump v. Hawaii* deference model and find that the President's determination of a national emergency is not for the Court to second-guess, leading to a "Tariffs lawful" ruling. I believe my probabilities account for these possibilities, with "Unlawful" being the second most likely outcome and "Lawful" being a small but non-trivial possibility. The 4% for procedural outcomes acknowledges the small chance the Court gets cold feet on such a politically charged case.

### 6. Final Normalization

After updating, I arrive at the following probabilities, which sum to 100%.

*   **Mixed ruling: 46%** - This is the most likely outcome. It offers a pragmatic compromise, allowing the Court to uphold the more targeted trafficking tariffs under a theory of national security deference while striking down the broad reciprocal tariffs under the Major Questions Doctrine.
*   **Tariffs unlawful: 40%** - The second most likely outcome. The Court's conservative majority could issue a sweeping ruling based on the MQD and nondelegation principles, finding that Congress never gave the President the power to impose tariffs via IEEPA.
*   **Tariffs lawful: 10%** - A small but non-zero chance. The Court could decide this case falls squarely under national security deference, extending the logic of *Trump v. Hawaii* and ruling that the President's emergency declarations and chosen remedies are beyond judicial review.
*   **Other ruling: 2%** - A procedural dismissal (e.g., as improvidently granted) is possible but unlikely given the expedited schedule.
*   **No 2025 ruling: 2%** - A delay past Dec 31, 2025, is also possible but unlikely for a case argued in early November.

Tariffs lawful: 10%
Tariffs unlawful: 40%
Mixed ruling: 46%
Other ruling: 2%
No 2025 ruling: 2%
