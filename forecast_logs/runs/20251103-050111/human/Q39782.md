### Reference class & base rates
-   **Reference Class 1: Longest Field Goal per Season (2014-2024).** In this 11-season span, the longest field goal made during the regular season has ranged from 58 yards (2019) to 66 yards (2021). The median longest kick was 61 yards. The average was 61.5 yards. This class suggests a baseline expectation in the low 60s, but with significant variance and an upward trend.
    -   *Limitation:* This class does not account for the 2025 rule change regarding "kicking balls" (K-balls) or the talent surge that has produced multiple 64+ yard kicks recently. The current season is already a significant outlier.
-   **Reference Class 2: All-Time Longest Field Goals (pre-2025).** Prior to this season, only five regular-season field goals of 63+ yards had ever been made. The record was 66 yards (Justin Tucker, 2021). Attempts from this range are exceptionally rare, often requiring a perfect confluence of game situation, weather/altitude, and kicker strength. This class establishes that breaking the previous record was a low-probability event in any given season.
    -   *Limitation:* This historical data is rapidly becoming obsolete due to evolving kicker skill and rule changes. It primarily serves to contextualize the magnitude of recent achievements.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
-   **2025-11-02** Cam Little kicks a 68-yard field goal. (↑↑↑) — This sets a new NFL record and establishes a hard floor for the final resolution value. The question is now whether this new record will be broken.
-   **2025-10-03** Reporting confirms the new K-ball rule is a plausible driver for longer kicks, though overall 50+ yard accuracy is flat. (↑) — This provides a causal mechanism for increased maximum distance, even if average accuracy isn't affected, as "broken-in" balls may travel farther.
-   **2025-09-29** A 65-yard field goal is made in Week 4. (↑↑) — Following a 64-yarder earlier in the season, this confirms that 64+ yard kicks are not a one-off event in 2025, suggesting a systemic change.
-   **2025-08-15** Cam Little kicks a 70-yard field goal in the preseason. (↑↑) — While not an official record, this serves as a crucial proof-of-concept for the maximum possible distance under current conditions and with current talent.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
-   **Kicker Specialization & Talent:** (Large) A new generation of kickers (e.g., Cam Little, Brandon Aubrey, Jake Moody) trained exclusively for modern techniques has joined established long-range threats (e.g., Justin Tucker, Matt Prater). This increases the pool of players capable of breaking records.
-   **The "K-Ball" Rule Change:** (Moderate) Allowing teams to prepare their designated kicking balls all week enables them to break them in. Softer, more pliable leather can lead to better compression on impact, potentially increasing flight distance by a few crucial yards on perfectly struck balls.
-   **Game Situation:** (Large) Record attempts almost exclusively occur at the end of a half or game, where a low-probability attempt has no downside (compared to a punt or Hail Mary). The frequency of these specific situations dictates opportunity.
-   **Altitude:** (Large) Kicking in Denver's Empower Field at Mile High provides a significant, well-documented distance boost due to thinner air. Three of the eight longest outdoor FGs in history were made there. The remaining 2025 schedule is a key variable.
-   **Analytics and Coaching Philosophy:** (Small) As long-range success rates climb, coaches may become marginally more willing to attempt kicks from 60+ yards, slightly increasing the number of opportunities for a record-breaking event.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
-   **Record Already Broken Mid-Season:** The reference class is based on an entire season's worth of data. The 2025 record has already been set at 68 yards with approximately half the season remaining, fundamentally changing the problem from "Will the 66-yard record be broken?" to "Will the 68-yard record be broken?".
-   **New K-Ball Rule:** This is a structural change not present in any historical reference class data. It introduces a new physical variable that appears to be increasing the maximum potential distance of a kick.
-   **Demonstrated Capability Ceiling:** Cam Little's 70-yard preseason kick provides a credible, albeit unofficial, data point for the upper bound of what is possible this season. This is a stronger signal of potential than existed in prior years.
-   **Concentration of Long-Distance Events:** The occurrence of 64, 65, and 68-yard field goals all within the first nine weeks of a single season is unprecedented and points towards a new kicking paradigm rather than a single outlier event.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
-   **Prior:** A prior based on the 2014-2024 reference class would be an extreme value distribution with a mode around 62-63 yards and a very thin tail extending past the previous record of 66 yards.
-   **Evidence mapping:**
    -   (↑↑↑) **Hard Floor at 68:** The successful 68-yard FG by Cam Little truncates the distribution. The probability of the final result being <68 yards is now zero.
    -   (↑↑) **Increased Ceiling:** The 70-yard preseason kick provides strong evidence that the physical limit of a kick under the new rules is at least 70 yards, pulling the upper tail of the distribution outward.
    -   (↑) **Systemic Shift:** The 64 and 65-yard kicks, combined with the K-ball rule mechanism, suggest the entire distribution of potential longest kicks has shifted to the right, not just a single fluke event.
-   **Net effect:** The posterior distribution is now conditioned on the result being ≥68. The probability mass that was previously spread across 62-67 yards is gone. The evidence suggests a non-trivial probability should be assigned to values of 69 and 70, as the conditions and talent that produced the 68-yarder still exist for the remainder of the season.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
-   **UP indicators:**
    -   Any field goal *attempt* of 65+ yards, even if missed.
    -   Games played by elite long-range kickers (Little, Tucker, Aubrey, Prater) in Denver.
    -   Public statements from coaches about their kicker's maximum range in practice.
    -   End-of-half/game situations in domes or warm-weather stadiums involving teams with strong-legged kickers.
-   **DOWN indicators:**
    -   Injuries to any of the top 5-6 kickers with demonstrated 65+ yard range.
    -   Teams in playoff contention playing conservatively at the end of halves, opting for Hail Marys over long FGs.
    -   Remaining games for top kickers being played in notoriously difficult, cold/windy outdoor stadiums (e.g., Chicago, Green Bay, Cleveland in December/January).
    -   NFL investigation or statement clarifying/downplaying the effect of the K-ball rule.

### Caveats & pitfalls
-   **Stochasticity of Opportunity:** A record-breaking kick requires a rare intersection of game clock, field position, weather, and coaching willingness. The talent may exist, but the opportunity may not arise again this season.
-   **The "Fluke" Factor:** The 68-yard kick may have been a perfect strike under perfect conditions that is difficult to replicate. It could represent the absolute ceiling for this season.
-   **End-of-Season Weather:** As the season progresses into December and January, worsening weather in many NFL cities will create headwinds and colder, denser air, making long-distance kicks significantly more difficult.
-   **Data Scarcity:** We are operating on a very small sample of 65+ yard kicks in the new "K-ball" era. The true effect of the rule change is still uncertain.
-   **Resolution Definition:** The question resolves on the regular season only. A longer kick in the playoffs would not count, and teams may be more conservative in the final weeks to protect player health for the postseason.

**Final Research Summary:**
The longest field goal of the 2025 season is already a record-breaking 68 yards. The key question is now whether this new record will be surpassed in the remaining weeks, a plausible scenario given the demonstrated 70-yard potential and systemic rule changes favoring kickers.

To forecast the longest field goal of the 2025 NFL season, we will follow the outlined Bayesian reasoning steps:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - **Reference Class 1:** Longest field goal per season from 2014-2024, with a median of 61 yards and an average of 61.5 yards. This suggests a baseline expectation in the low 60s, but with significant variance and an upward trend.
   - **Reference Class 2:** All-time longest field goals (pre-2025), with a record of 66 yards before 2025. This establishes that breaking the previous record was a low-probability event in any given season.
   - **Chosen Base Rate:** The prior distribution is centered around 62-63 yards with a thin tail extending past 66 yards, reflecting historical trends and the rarity of record-breaking kicks.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - **Similarities:** The historical data provides a baseline for understanding the typical range of longest field goals.
   - **Differences:** The 2025 season has already seen a 68-yard field goal, breaking the previous record. The new K-ball rule and demonstrated capability of a 70-yard kick in preseason suggest a shift in the distribution towards longer distances.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **68-yard field goal (↑↑↑):** Sets a new record and establishes a floor for the season's longest kick.
   - **70-yard preseason kick (↑↑):** Demonstrates the potential for even longer kicks under current conditions.
   - **K-ball rule change (↑):** Provides a mechanism for increased maximum distances, even if average accuracy remains unchanged.
   - **Multiple 64+ yard kicks (↑↑):** Indicates a systemic shift rather than isolated events.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - **Prior:** Extreme value distribution centered around 62-63 yards.
   - **Likelihood:** Evidence of a 68-yard kick and potential for 70 yards shifts the distribution rightward.
   - **Posterior:** The distribution is now conditioned on the result being ≥68 yards, with significant probability mass assigned to 69 and 70 yards.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the stochastic nature of opportunities and potential for adverse weather conditions.
   - **Alternative Scenarios:** A fluke event or lack of opportunity could prevent further record-breaking kicks.
   - **Adjustment:** Account for tail risks and ensure a balanced distribution.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Given the evidence and Bayesian update, the percentiles are adjusted to reflect the new floor and potential for further record-breaking kicks.

P10: 68  
P20: 68  
P40: 69  
P60: 69  
P80: 70  
P90: 70

# Forecast: Longest Field Goal of the 2025 NFL Season

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll use two reference classes to establish my prior:

**Primary Reference Class**: Longest field goal per NFL season from 2014-2024
- Median: 61 yards
- Mean: 61.5 yards
- Range: 58-66 yards
- Standard deviation: ~2.5 yards

**Secondary Reference Class**: All-time longest field goals (pre-2025)
- Record: 66 yards (Justin Tucker, 2021)
- Only five regular-season field goals of 63+ yards had ever been made

I'm selecting these reference classes because they provide both recent seasonal trends and historical context for extreme values. The first gives us typical season-long maximums, while the second helps understand the rarity of record-breaking kicks.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate**:
- Same fundamental activity (NFL field goal kicking)
- Similar physical constraints (field dimensions, ball specifications)
- Same general talent pool (professional NFL kickers)

**Key differences**:
- The 2025 season already has a 68-yard field goal, breaking the previous record
- New "kicking ball" rule allowing teams to practice with game balls all week
- Demonstrated capability of 70 yards in preseason (Cam Little)
- Multiple 64+ yard kicks already this season, suggesting a systemic shift
- We're only halfway through the season, with many opportunities remaining

These differences strongly suggest the distribution has shifted upward compared to historical data.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence pushing forecast upward**:
- **68-yard field goal already made** (Very strong ↑↑↑): This establishes a hard floor and demonstrates capability under game conditions.
- **70-yard preseason kick** (Strong ↑↑): Shows the physical ceiling is at least 70 yards under optimal conditions.
- **Multiple 64+ yard kicks this season** (Moderate ↑): Indicates this isn't a single outlier but a pattern.
- **K-ball rule change** (Moderate ↑): Provides a causal mechanism for increased distances.

**Evidence pushing forecast downward**:
- **Weather deterioration** (Moderate ↓): As the season progresses into winter, conditions will worsen in many stadiums.
- **Playoff-bound teams may be conservative** (Weak ↓): Teams with postseason aspirations might avoid risky long attempts.
- **Rarity of opportunity** (Moderate ↓): Perfect game situations for 68+ yard attempts are uncommon.

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior distribution centered around 61-62 yards with a standard deviation of ~2.5 yards:

**First update - 68-yard kick already made**:
- This truncates my distribution at 68 yards (P(result < 68) = 0)
- The probability mass previously below 68 must be redistributed above it
- This is an extreme update that completely shifts the distribution

**Second update - 70-yard preseason demonstration**:
- This extends the plausible upper range to at least 70 yards
- Increases probability density in the 68-70 yard range
- Suggests non-zero probability for 71+ yards

**Third update - Multiple 64+ yard kicks this season**:
- Confirms the systemic shift rather than a single outlier
- Increases confidence in the new distribution centered above historical norms

**Resulting posterior**:
- Lower bound: 68 yards (100% certainty)
- Mode: 68 yards (most likely no further records)
- Upper tail: Extends to ~72 yards with rapidly diminishing probability

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots**:
- I may be overestimating the likelihood of another record-breaking kick. The 68-yarder could be a perfect confluence of factors unlikely to repeat.
- I might be underestimating the effect of deteriorating weather conditions as the season progresses.
- The remaining schedule may not provide optimal opportunities (Denver games, dome games, end-of-half situations).

**Alternative forecast**:
A reasonable alternative would place more probability mass at exactly 68 yards (>80% chance), with minimal probability above 69 yards. This would emphasize the rarity of record-breaking kicks and the fact that we've already seen an outlier.

**Rebuttal**: The multiple 64+ yard kicks and the 70-yard preseason demonstration provide strong evidence that the physical capability exists for kicks beyond 68 yards. With half a season remaining, including games in favorable conditions, the probability of exceeding 68 yards is non-trivial.

**Adjustment**: I'll slightly increase my probability at 68 yards to account for the possibility that we've already seen the season maximum.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

My initial prior is based on the historical distribution of the longest field goal made in each NFL regular season. The research report provides data for the 2014-2024 seasons.

*   **Reference Class:** Longest regular-season field goal by year, 2014-2024.
*   **Reasoning:** This class represents the "normal" state of affairs in the modern NFL before the significant changes of the 2025 season. It captures the baseline talent, strategy, and environmental factors.
*   **Distribution:** The data shows a range from 58 to 66 yards, with a mean of 61.5 yards and a median of 61 yards. This suggests a distribution centered in the low 60s, with values above 65 being exceptionally rare (the previous record of 66 was a significant outlier). The probability of a kick of 68+ yards in a given season under these prior conditions would be extremely low, likely less than 1%.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

The 2025 season is fundamentally different from the base rate period due to several key factors.

*   **Similarities:** The basic game situations that prompt long field goal attempts (end of half/game) remain the same. The laws of physics and the general talent pool of kickers are an evolution of, not a revolution from, the base rate period.
*   **Differences:**
    *   **Rule Change (K-balls):** The new rule allowing teams to prepare their "kicking balls" all week is a significant structural change. The plausible mechanism is that "broken-in" balls are more pliable, allowing for better energy transfer and thus greater distance on perfectly struck kicks. This suggests the entire upper tail of the potential distance distribution has shifted outwards.
    *   **Demonstrated Performance in 2025:** The 2025 season has already seen an unprecedented number of long kicks (64, 65, and a new record of 68 yards). This is not a theoretical shift; it is an observed one.
    *   **Hard Constraint:** The most crucial difference is that a 68-yard field goal has already been made by Cam Little. This renders the lower part of the historical distribution irrelevant. The question is no longer "What will the longest kick be?" but rather "Will the new 68-yard record be broken?".

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will update my prior based on the new evidence from 2025.

*   **Evidence 1: Cam Little's 68-yard FG (Nov 2, 2025).** This is the strongest possible evidence. It acts as a hard constraint, truncating the probability distribution. The probability of the final result being less than 68 yards is now zero. This forces a complete re-evaluation from the prior.
*   **Evidence 2: Cam Little's 70-yard preseason FG.** This is a powerful proof of concept. It demonstrates that a 70-yard kick is physically achievable by a current kicker under the new rules. While a preseason kick is not under the same pressure as a regular-season one, it makes a 69 or 70-yard outcome far more plausible than it would be otherwise. This significantly increases the likelihood of values in the 69-71 yard range.
*   **Evidence 3: Multiple 64+ yard FGs in 2025.** The 64 and 65-yard kicks early in the season indicate that the increase in maximum distance is a systemic effect, not a single fluke event by one player. This increases the probability that another opportunity for a record-breaking kick will arise for one of several capable kickers.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

*   **Conceptual Update:** Posterior ∝ Prior × Likelihood.
*   **Step 1: Applying the Hard Constraint.** My prior distribution was centered around 61-62 yards. The observation of a 68-yard kick effectively multiplies the entire region < 68 yards by a likelihood of zero. All of the probability mass must be re-assigned to values of 68 or greater. My posterior distribution is now P(X | X ≥ 68).
*   **Step 2: Adjusting for New Ceiling.** The evidence of the 70-yard preseason kick and the systemic nature of the long kicks this season provides a strong likelihood ratio in favor of higher outcomes. Where my prior might have seen a 69-yard kick as 10x less likely than a 63-yard kick, the new evidence suggests a 69 or 70-yard kick is a plausible outcome.
*   **Posterior Shape:** The resulting posterior distribution is heavily concentrated at 68 yards, as this is the current, confirmed record. However, there is now a significant "right tail" representing the non-trivial chance that the record is broken again. I estimate roughly a 60% chance the record stands at 68, and a 40% chance it is broken. This 40% is distributed across 69, 70, and (less likely) 71 yards.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

*   **Alternative Scenario:** The 68-yard kick was the "perfect storm"—the absolute maximum possible outcome for this season. Coaches, seeing this, might become more conservative, realizing that attempts from further out are futile. Furthermore, winter weather is approaching, which will make long kicks in outdoor stadiums in the north significantly harder, reducing the number of viable opportunities. In this world, the record remains at 68. This is a very strong argument and is why the majority of my probability mass remains at 68.
*   **Rebuttal:** The "genie is out of the bottle." Multiple kickers and coaches now know that 68-70 yards is within the realm of possibility. Opportunities in domes or in Denver (where the altitude helps) will still exist regardless of the weather elsewhere. The incentive to attempt a record-breaking kick with no time on the clock is high. The 40% chance of the record being broken accounts for the stochasticity of opportunity and the countervailing force of worsening weather.
*   **Tail Risk:** Could someone hit a 72+ yarder? This seems extremely unlikely. The 70-yard preseason kick feels like a realistic ceiling. A 71-yarder would likely require perfect conditions (e.g., in Denver with a tailwind). I will assign very little probability mass above 70.

### 6. Final Percentiles

My final distribution is anchored at 68 yards, with a significant probability that the record is broken. The median and mode are both 68, but the mean is slightly higher due to the right tail.

*   **P(X=68) ≈ 60%** (The record stands)
*   **P(X=69) ≈ 25%** (The record is broken by one yard)
*   **P(X=70) ≈ 10%** (Matching the preseason proof-of-concept)
*   **P(X≥71) ≈ 5%** (An extreme, but possible, outcome)

This probability distribution translates to the following percentiles:

P10: 68
P20: 68
P40: 68
P60: 68
P80: 69
P90: 70
