Here is my research plan.

### **Step 1: Identify Core Research Questions**

1.  **Historical Baseline:** What is the historical frequency of the Insurrection Act's invocation? What is the most relevant reference class (e.g., all of U.S. history, post-WWII, post-Vietnam)? This will establish the base rate.
2.  **Actor Analysis (Trump):** What is President Trump's specific history, rhetoric, and stated intent regarding the Insurrection Act? What are the plans of his key allies and associated organizations (e.g., Project 2025)? This helps understand the primary agent's disposition.
3.  **Trigger Conditions:** What specific scenarios or events would most likely precipitate an invocation between now (November 2025) and the end of the year? This involves analyzing potential sources of major civil unrest, border crises, or other perceived emergencies.
4.  **Constraints & Countervailing Forces:** What institutional, political, and legal factors would prevent or discourage an invocation? This includes potential resistance from the military, the courts, Congress, and the public.
5.  **Resolution Criteria Analysis:** What constitutes a "formal invocation" as reported by "credible sources"? This is crucial to avoid being misled by threats or informal deployments. It requires a clear, official act.
6.  **Recency Analysis:** Given the short horizon (<2 months), what recent events (last 6 months) are most salient? The provided sources are key here, indicating a live and ongoing discussion within the administration.

### **Step 2: Proposed Search Queries**

1.  **Historical Baseline:**
    *   `history of Insurrection Act invocations US`
    *   `list of presidents who used Insurrection Act`
    *   `last time Insurrection Act was invoked`
    *   `Insurrection Act use since 1970`
2.  **Actor Analysis (Trump):**
    *   `Donald Trump quotes "Insurrection Act" 2025`
    *   `Project 2025 Insurrection Act domestic deployment`
    *   `Trump plans for Justice Department second term`
    *   `Trump executive order border Insurrection Act`
3.  **Trigger Conditions:**
    *   `US civil unrest forecast winter 2025-2026`
    *   `protests against Trump administration 2025`
    *   `US southern border situation November 2025` (hypothetical search)
4.  **Constraints & Countervailing Forces:**
    *   `military leadership resistance domestic deployment`
    *   `legal challenges to Insurrection Act invocation`
    *   `Posse Comitatus Act and Insurrection Act explained`
    *   `political consequences of invoking Insurrection Act`
5.  **Resolution Criteria Analysis:**
    *   `procedure for "formally invoking" Insurrection Act`
    *   `what is an executive order to invoke Insurrection Act`

### **Step 3: Synthesize Key Findings**

*   **Base Rate:** The Insurrection Act has been invoked dozens of times historically, but its use has become extremely rare in the modern era. The last clear use was in 1992 for the L.A. riots. Before that, it was primarily used during the Civil Rights era. A modern (post-1970) base rate is very low, on the order of once every 20-30 years, translating to a ~3-5% chance in any given year.
*   **Trump's Intent:** The provided sources are unanimous and clear: Trump and his allies have explicitly and repeatedly planned for the use of the Insurrection Act as a primary tool of governance. This is not a reactive contingency plan but a proactive strategy for dealing with dissent, crime, and immigration. The planning (Project 2025) and rhetoric are detailed and consistent.
*   **Triggers:** The most likely triggers within the short (~7 week) timeframe are large-scale civil unrest (e.g., protests that escalate) or a manufactured or real crisis at the southern border framed as an "invasion."
*   **Constraints:** The primary constraints are institutional. The military leadership is historically and culturally averse to domestic law enforcement roles. The judiciary would almost certainly issue immediate injunctions, leading to a constitutional crisis. Political backlash, even from some Republicans, would be severe.
*   **Key Tension:** The core of the question is a conflict between an extremely low historical base rate and an actor with an unprecedentedly high and publicly stated intent to use the power. The current situation is a significant departure from the historical norm. The short timeline is a critical variable; a triggering event must occur soon.

### **Step 4: Draft the Comprehensive Answer**

---
### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Post-WWII Presidential Administrations (1945-2024):** The Insurrection Act has been formally invoked approximately 10-12 times in this ~80-year period, primarily during the Civil Rights era (1950s-60s) and the 1992 L.A. riots. This suggests a base rate of roughly one invocation every 7-8 years, or a ~13% chance in any given presidential term.
2.  **Modern "Era of Restraint" (1970-2024):** Use of the Act has become exceptionally rare. The only major invocation in this ~55-year period was in 1992. This reference class suggests a base rate of <2% per year, or <10% per presidential term. This is likely the more relevant class due to changes in legal norms and public opinion regarding domestic military use.
3.  **Limitations:** Both reference classes involve presidents acting reactively to unforeseen crises (e.g., riots, resistance to federal court orders). The current situation involves proactive, pre-emptive planning for its use as a policy tool, making historical comparisons difficult.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   [2025-11-06] Harvard Explainer highlights the unusual nature of Trump's "casual invocation" threats and the Act's vague language. ↑ — Normalizes the discussion and reinforces the president's broad discretion, lowering the perceived barrier to use.
*   [2025-10-27] PBS report confirms Trump's repeated statements on using the Act for crime or unrest without waiting for governors' requests. ↑ — Shows consistent, long-term intent and a willingness to override traditional federalist constraints.
*   [2025-10-10] Military.com reports on active consideration of the Act to deploy troops in cities, bypassing courts. ↑ — Indicates this is not just rhetoric but a live policy option being debated within the administration now.
*   [2025-06-09] FCNL report details plans to use the Act for mass deportations and to suppress protests, citing a Jan 2025 executive order. ↑ — Establishes a specific, planned-for trigger (migration) and links it directly to the Act.
*   [2024-10-01] American Progress analysis of Project 2025 frames the Act as a key tool for creating an "imperial presidency." ↑ — Provides evidence of deep, ideological planning for its use that predates the administration.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Large-Scale Civil Unrest:** A major protest, especially if it involves property damage or violence, is the most probable trigger. This would provide the administration with a public justification. (Size: Large)
2.  **Perceived Border Crisis:** Framing a surge in migration as an "invasion" that overwhelms state and local authorities could serve as a pretext, as planned by allies. (Size: Moderate)
3.  **Personnel & Loyalty:** The appointment of loyalists to key posts (SecDef, Attorney General) who are unlikely to challenge a presidential order is a critical enabler. (Size: Large)
4.  **Institutional Resistance (Military/DOJ):** Pushback from the Joint Chiefs of Staff or career DOJ lawyers could delay or block an order, as seen in Trump's first term. This is the primary constraint. (Size: Large)
5.  **Judicial Intervention:** Federal courts would likely issue immediate restraining orders, creating a constitutional clash over whether the President must obey. (Size: Moderate)
6.  **Political Calculation:** The immense political and public backlash could be a deterrent if the administration believes it would jeopardize other policy goals. (Size: Moderate)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Proactive vs. Reactive Intent:** Past invocations were reactive responses to specific, unforeseen events. Trump's consideration is part of a proactive, pre-planned strategy (Project 2025) to achieve policy goals (immigration, suppressing dissent).
*   **Broad vs. Specific Justification:** Historically, the Act was used for discrete tasks like enforcing a specific court order (Little Rock) or quelling a specific riot (L.A.). The current discussion involves broad, ongoing issues like border control or generalized urban crime.
*   **Centralized Planning:** The existence of a detailed, publicly-discussed playbook like Project 2025, which explicitly names the Insurrection Act as a tool, has no historical precedent.
*   **Rhetorical Framing:** The deliberate framing of protests as "insurrection" and migration as an "invasion" is a rhetorical strategy designed to fit potential events into the Act's legal framework.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with the modern reference class base rate. A prior centered around 2-5% for any given year seems appropriate, reflecting its extreme rarity but non-zero possibility (equivalent n ≈ 50).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   ↑ (Large): Overwhelming evidence of explicit, long-term, and detailed planning (Project 2025) and consistent personal rhetoric from the principal actor.
    *   ↑ (Moderate): The administration has already laid the groundwork by framing potential triggers (border, protests) in language that aligns with the Act's justification.
    *   ↑ (Small): The Jan 2025 executive order to review the Act's use shows early administrative action.
    *   ↓ (Moderate): The short time horizon (<2 months) means a suitable triggering event must manifest quickly. The absence of such an event thus far is weak evidence for restraint.
    *   ↓ (Moderate): Significant institutional friction from the judiciary and potentially the military remains a powerful, though perhaps diminished, check on this power.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly suggests this administration is a major outlier compared to the reference class. The posterior probability should be moved substantially upward from the low single-digit base rate.

To forecast the probability of President Trump formally invoking the Insurrection Act before 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Historical Frequency:** The Insurrection Act has been invoked approximately 10-12 times since 1945, with the last clear invocation in 1992. This suggests a base rate of about once every 7-8 years, or roughly a 13% chance per presidential term. However, in the modern era (post-1970), its use has been extremely rare, suggesting a base rate of less than 2% per year.
- **Chosen Base Rate:** Given the rarity of invocation in recent decades, a base rate of 2-5% per year is appropriate. This reflects the low historical frequency but acknowledges the non-zero possibility.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** The base case involves rare, reactive invocations in response to specific crises.
- **Differences:** The current situation involves proactive planning and rhetoric from President Trump and his allies, suggesting a higher likelihood than historical norms. The explicit intent and planning (Project 2025) are unprecedented.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Evidence of Intent:** Trump's rhetoric and Project 2025 indicate a strong intent to use the Act, increasing the likelihood of invocation.
  - **Likelihood Ratio:** High likelihood of invocation given this evidence compared to historical norms.
- **Institutional Resistance:** Military and judicial resistance remain significant barriers, decreasing the likelihood.
  - **Likelihood Ratio:** Lower likelihood of successful invocation due to these constraints.
- **Short Timeframe:** The need for a triggering event within 7 weeks reduces the probability.
  - **Likelihood Ratio:** Decreases likelihood due to time constraints.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
- **Prior Odds:** Assume a base rate of 3% (prior probability of 0.03).
- **Evidence Impact:** The strong evidence of intent significantly increases the probability, while institutional resistance and the short timeframe decrease it.
- **Posterior Odds Calculation:**
  - Adjusted for strong intent: Increase prior odds by a factor of 2 (e.g., from 0.03 to 0.06).
  - Adjusted for resistance and timeframe: Decrease by a factor of 0.5 (e.g., from 0.06 to 0.03).
- **Posterior Probability:** Approximately 3%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the possibility of overestimating Trump's willingness to face institutional backlash.
- **Alternative Scenarios:** A major crisis could still occur, increasing the likelihood.
- **Rebuttals:** Institutional checks may be stronger than anticipated, reducing the probability.
- **Adjustment:** Given these considerations, a slight upward adjustment to account for potential crises is warranted.

### 6. Final Forecast
- **Final Probability:** Considering the base rate, evidence, and red team analysis, the final probability is adjusted to reflect the increased likelihood due to Trump's intent but tempered by institutional constraints and the short timeframe.

Final: 5%

# Will President Trump formally invoke the Insurrection Act before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

To establish a base rate, I'll examine the historical frequency of Insurrection Act invocations:

- **Modern Era (1970-2024)**: The Act has been invoked only once (1992 LA riots) in approximately 55 years. This suggests a base rate of ~1.8% per year.
- **Post-WWII (1945-2024)**: The Act was invoked 10-12 times over 80 years, primarily during the Civil Rights era and the 1992 LA riots, suggesting a base rate of ~13% per presidential term or ~3.3% per year.

Given that modern norms around military deployment have shifted significantly since the Civil Rights era, the more recent reference class (1970-2024) is more appropriate. However, this question covers only a ~7-week period (Nov 11 - Dec 31, 2025), not a full year.

**Initial prior**: ~0.25% chance (1.8% annual rate × 7/52 weeks remaining in 2025)

This extremely low prior reflects the rarity of Insurrection Act invocations in modern times and the short time window remaining in 2025.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case**:
- The legal framework and constitutional constraints remain the same
- Institutional resistance from military leadership and judiciary would be expected
- Public backlash to domestic military deployment remains a significant concern

**Key differences**:
- **Explicit planning**: Unlike previous reactive uses, Trump and allies have explicitly planned for proactive use of the Act (Project 2025)
- **Stated intent**: Trump has repeatedly and publicly discussed using the Act for immigration enforcement and urban crime
- **Ideological alignment**: Key administration positions are likely filled with officials supportive of this approach
- **Rhetorical framing**: Deliberate framing of protests as "insurrection" and migration as "invasion" to fit the Act's legal framework

These differences significantly increase the likelihood compared to the historical base rate.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Project 2025 and explicit planning documents**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.9) - If Trump plans to invoke the Act, detailed planning would be expected
- P(E|~H): Low (~0.1) - Such explicit planning would be unusual if there was no intent to use it
- Likelihood ratio: ~9.0 (strongly increases probability)

**Evidence 2: Trump's repeated public statements about using the Act**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.95) - Public rhetoric would align with actual intent
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.3) - Could be political posturing without actual intent
- Likelihood ratio: ~3.2 (moderately increases probability)

**Evidence 3: January 2025 executive order to review the Act's use**
- P(E|H): High (~0.8) - Administrative groundwork would precede actual invocation
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.4) - Could be symbolic or preparatory without intent to use
- Likelihood ratio: ~2.0 (slightly increases probability)

**Evidence 4: Short time horizon (only 7 weeks remaining)**
- P(E|H): Low (~0.2) - A suitable triggering event must occur quickly
- P(E|~H): High (~0.8) - Limited time reduces opportunity for invocation
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.25 (moderately decreases probability)

**Evidence 5: Absence of major triggering event thus far**
- P(E|H): Moderate (~0.4) - A triggering event could still emerge
- P(E|~H): High (~0.8) - Absence suggests continued normal governance
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.5 (slightly decreases probability)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with our prior of 0.25% (0.0025 probability):

Prior odds = 0.0025 / 0.9975 = 0.0025

First update (Project 2025 planning):
Posterior odds = 0.0025 × 9.0 = 0.0225
Posterior probability = 0.0225 / (1 + 0.0225) = 0.022 or 2.2%

Second update (Trump's public statements):
Posterior odds = 0.022 / 0.978 × 3.2 = 0.072
Posterior probability = 0.072 / (1 + 0.072) = 0.067 or 6.7%

Third update (Executive order review):
Posterior odds = 0.067 / 0.933 × 2.0 = 0.144
Posterior probability = 0.144 / (1 + 0.144) = 0.126 or 12.6%

Fourth update (Short time horizon):
Posterior odds = 0.126 / 0.874 × 0.25 = 0.036
Posterior probability = 0.036 / (1 + 0.036) = 0.035 or 3.5%

Fifth update (Absence of triggering event):
Posterior odds = 0.035 / 0.965 × 0.5 = 0.018
Posterior probability = 0.018 / (1 + 0.018) = 0.018 or 1.8%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots**:
- I may be underestimating the likelihood of a manufactured crisis to justify invocation
- The administration might have plans for invocation that aren't publicly known
- I might be overestimating institutional resistance given personnel changes

**Alternative scenarios**:
- A border "crisis" could be declared in December as a symbolic first-term action
- Protests against administration policies could escalate and provide justification
- The Act could be invoked but immediately challenged in courts, creating ambiguity about resolution

**Counterarguments**:
- The political costs of invoking the Act might outweigh benefits this early in the term
- The administration might prefer to establish other priorities before taking such a controversial step
- Legal advisors might counsel against such a move without a clear emergency

After considering these factors, I believe my estimate of 1.8% is reasonable but should be adjusted slightly upward to account for the possibility of manufactured crises or non-public planning.

## 6. Final Forecast

Considering the extremely low historical base rate, the short time window remaining in 2025, but also the unprecedented explicit planning and stated intent to use the Act, I arrive at a final probability of 3%.

Final: 3%

Here is my probabilistic forecast reasoning:

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The event in question is the formal invocation of the Insurrection Act within a very short timeframe (~7 weeks, from mid-November 2025 to January 1, 2026).

To establish a prior probability, I will use the "modern era" reference class of U.S. presidencies from 1970 to 2024. In this ~55-year period, the Act has been formally invoked only once in a major way (1992 Los Angeles riots).

*   **Calculation:** 1 invocation / 55 years ≈ 1.8% chance per year.
*   **Timeframe Adjustment:** The question covers approximately 1.5 months, or 1/8th of a year.
*   **Base Rate (Prior):** The prior probability for a generic president in this specific timeframe is 1.8% / 8 ≈ 0.225%.

My initial prior, P(H), is **0.2%**. This reflects the extreme rarity of this event in modern American history.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation differs from the base case in one critical dimension: the specific actor.

*   **Similarity:** The institutional and legal structures of the U.S. government (the military's traditional aversion to domestic roles, an independent judiciary, the Posse Comitatus Act) remain the same as in the reference period. These create significant friction against using the Act.
*   **Difference:** Unlike previous presidents who used the Act as a reluctant, last-resort measure in response to unforeseen crises, the research report indicates that Donald Trump and his allies (e.g., in Project 2025) have proactively and publicly planned to use the Insurrection Act as a primary tool of governance. This includes using it to quell protests, manage the border, and address crime. This represents a fundamental departure from the historical norm, where intent was reactive rather than proactive.

Because the actor's stated intent is so radically different from the presidents in the reference class, a very large update from the prior is warranted.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will use a simple causal model: for the event to happen, a triggering crisis must occur, and then the President must choose to invoke the Act in response.

P(Invocation) = P(Trigger Event) × P(Invocation | Trigger Event)

*   **Evidence 1: The need for a Trigger Event.** The Act cannot be invoked in a vacuum; it requires a pretext of "insurrection," "rebellion," or obstruction of law that state authorities cannot handle. The probability of such an event (e.g., large-scale civil unrest that escalates, a border situation framed as an "invasion") occurring in the next ~7 weeks is not negligible, but also not certain. The political environment is volatile, but the timeframe is short. I estimate **P(Trigger Event) ≈ 20%**.

*   **Evidence 2: The President's Propensity to Act.** Given a plausible trigger, what is the likelihood President Trump would choose to invoke the Act?
    *   **For (Increases Probability):** The extensive planning (Project 2025), consistent rhetoric, and stated intention to install loyalists in key positions (like Secretary of Defense) who would not push back as they did in 2020. This evidence is very strong.
    *   **Against (Decreases Probability):** Significant institutional constraints remain (courts, military bureaucracy). Furthermore, there are less controversial alternatives, such as federalizing the National Guard or using other federal law enforcement agencies. The political firestorm from using the Act could be immense and might be seen as too costly, even for this administration.
    *   **Likelihood Estimate:** Balancing his high intent against the remaining constraints and available alternatives, I estimate the conditional probability, **P(Invocation | Trigger Event) ≈ 40%**. This is an exceptionally high number for any president but reflects the unique circumstances.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Instead of multiplying likelihood ratios against the tiny prior, I will use the causal model which is more intuitive for this problem.

*   **Prior:** 0.2% (for a generic president).
*   **Model:** P(H) = P(Trigger Event) × P(Invocation | Trigger Event)
*   **Calculation:** P(H) = 20% × 40% = 8%

The evidence of specific, proactive intent from this particular president moves the probability from an extremely rare "black swan" event (0.2%) to a plausible "tail risk" scenario (8%). This represents a 40-fold increase from the base rate, which is a massive but justified update given the strength of the evidence about the actor's intentions.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast could be wrong in several ways:
*   **Too Low:** I might be underestimating the probability of a trigger event in a volatile post-election environment. I might also be underestimating Trump's resolve and the effectiveness of his plans to sideline institutional resistance. If P(Trigger) is 30% and P(Invoke|Trigger) is 60%, the forecast would be 18%.
*   **Too High:** I might be taking the planning and rhetoric too literally. When faced with the reality, the administration could easily opt for a less controversial tool to project strength. The short timeframe is a major constraint; if no crisis materializes by mid-December, the probability drops significantly. If P(Trigger) is only 10% and P(Invoke|Trigger) is only 20% (due to choosing other options), the forecast would be 2%.

The 8% forecast sits between these extremes. It acknowledges the high intent but respects the real-world frictions and the need for a specific crisis to emerge quickly. The existence of less controversial alternatives is the strongest argument for keeping the probability below 10-15%.

### 6. Final Forecast
My final forecast is the result of the causal model, which balances the need for a triggering event with the uniquely high propensity of this specific president to use this authority.

Final: 8%
