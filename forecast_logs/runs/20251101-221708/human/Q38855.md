### Reference class & base rates
*   **US Government Imposing Quantitative Domestic Possession Caps on General-Purpose Technology/Resources:** This is the most direct reference class. Historically, the US government has rarely, if ever, placed a hard cap on the *total amount* of a broadly available, economically vital resource or technology that a domestic company or individual can possess. Regulation typically focuses on *use* (e.g., nuclear materials), *safety standards* (e.g., pharmaceuticals), or *exports* (e.g., advanced semiconductors), not on domestic accumulation limits. The base rate for such an unprecedented economic intervention is extremely low, likely **< 5%** over a given two-year period.
*   **Major New Tech-Specific Regulatory Regimes:** This class includes the creation of significant new regulatory frameworks for emerging technologies (e.g., aviation, internet, biotech). While regulation is common, laws that impose hard quantitative limits are an extreme outlier. The process is typically slow, contentious, and heavily lobbied, often taking many years from proposal to implementation. The base rate for a *restrictive cap* (not just a general regulatory framework) being passed within two years of the issue gaining prominence is very low, perhaps **5-10%**.
*   **"Sin" or "Safety" Taxes/Restrictions on Production/Consumption:** This class includes things like carbon taxes, cigarette taxes, or gun control measures (e.g., magazine capacity limits). While these involve restrictions, they are typically on specific end-products deemed harmful, not on a foundational, general-purpose input like compute. Applying this logic to compute is a weak analogy, but it's the closest historical example of quantitative limits. The success rate of such proposals is highly variable and politically charged, but still suggests a low base rate for a novel application like this.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-10-30** Meta's 12% stock collapse signals AI spending boom may be ending. — **↓** — A market cooldown reduces the perceived urgency for regulators to curb an out-of-control capabilities race, decreasing the political will for drastic measures like compute caps.
*   **2025-09-15** Leaked draft of a bipartisan Senate AI bill focuses on transparency, watermarking, and liability reform, but contains no provisions for compute caps. — **↓** — Indicates that the legislative center of gravity is around "soft" governance and accountability, not hard resource limits, making caps an unlikely last-minute addition.
*   **2025-08-22** The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) releases its updated AI Risk Management Framework, emphasizing voluntary evaluation and testing standards for frontier models. — **↓** — The executive branch's primary technical body is signaling a preference for a standards-based, voluntary approach, which is philosophically opposed to mandatory possession caps.
*   **2025-07-10** A prominent AI safety organization publishes a paper arguing that compute thresholds are the only verifiable way to prevent dangerous capabilities, briefly reigniting the debate. — **↑** — Injects the core argument for caps back into the policy discourse, but lacks immediate legislative traction.
*   **2025-06-05** At a congressional hearing, CEOs from major AI labs uniformly testify that compute caps would cripple US innovation and cede leadership to geopolitical rivals. — **↓** — Demonstrates a powerful, unified industry front against the proposal, creating a significant political barrier to passage.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **Catastrophic AI Incident:** A clear, unambiguous, and high-profile incident causing significant harm (e.g., a major cybersecurity breach, large-scale disinformation event, economic disruption) directly attributable to a newly developed AI model. This is the primary driver that could overcome political inertia. (Size: Large)
*   **Geopolitical Competition:** The argument that restricting US companies will allow China or other rivals to surpass the US in a critical technology. This is a powerful, bipartisan argument against any form of restriction. (Size: Large)
*   **Legislative/Regulatory Inertia:** The US federal government's default state. The process of drafting, debating, and passing a contentious law, especially one with massive economic implications, is exceptionally slow and difficult. With less than two months to resolution, this is a dominant factor. (Size: Large)
*   **Industry Lobbying:** Tech companies have immense lobbying power and financial resources. They would aggressively campaign against any measure that fundamentally limits their ability to build and deploy new models, framing it as anti-competitive and anti-innovation. (Size: Large)
*   **Scientific Consensus Shift:** A sudden, credible warning from a critical mass of top AI scientists that uncontrollable AGI is imminent and that compute is the only viable control knob. This could create a "Sputnik moment" for policymakers. (Size: Moderate)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Perceived Existential Stakes:** Unlike most previously regulated technologies, a subset of influential actors views advanced AI as a potential existential threat, justifying unprecedented interventions like compute caps.
*   **Concentration of Resources:** The required compute for training frontier models is concentrated in a handful of large corporations. This makes the target of regulation appear to be a small, identifiable group, potentially making it seem more politically feasible than a broad-based restriction.
*   **Pace of Change:** AI capabilities are advancing at a rate far exceeding prior technological waves, creating a sense of urgency among policymakers that could, in theory, short-circuit normal legislative timelines.
*   **Intangibility and Dual-Use Nature:** Compute is a foundational, general-purpose resource. Capping it is like capping electricity or steel for certain actors, a far more fundamental intervention than regulating a specific end-product like a weapon or a drug. This makes it *less* like historical precedents.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a very low prior (e.g., 5%) based on the extreme rarity of this type of economic intervention in US history, with a strong equivalent n (e.g., n=20) due to the consistency of the historical record.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   **↓ (Large):** The extremely short timeline (<2 months) makes passing any major, contentious legislation nearly impossible.
    *   **↓ (Large):** The default legislative path is gridlock, and there is no existing bill with compute caps that has any momentum.
    *   **↓ (Moderate):** Recent market signals (Meta stock drop) and policy discourse (focus on transparency/liability) suggest the political energy for radical interventions is low and decreasing.
    *   **↓ (Moderate):** Unified and powerful industry opposition creates a formidable barrier.
    *   **↑ (Small):** The continued, albeit niche, advocacy from the AI safety community keeps the idea alive, representing a non-zero tail risk.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence overwhelmingly reinforces the low base rate. The posterior probability should be revised significantly downward from an already low prior.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Introduction of a bill with specific compute cap language that gains a prominent, bipartisan co-sponsor.
    *   A major, undeniable AI-caused disaster that is front-page news for several days.
    *   The President or a cabinet-level official (e.g., Commerce Secretary) publicly calls for considering compute limits.
    *   A major AI lab voluntarily pauses development and calls for government-mandated compute restrictions.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   The passage of any AI-related legislation that *omits* compute caps.
    *   Major new investment announcements from tech companies for next-generation data centers.
    *   Official US government statements emphasizing the need to "win the race" against China on AI.
    *   The end of the current congressional session without any action on the topic.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Definitional Ambiguity:** "Compute capacity" is not a legally defined term. A law could be passed with a symbolic but effectively meaningless definition (e.g., based on an obsolete metric) that resolves this question YES without having a real-world impact.
*   **Legislative Vehicle:** A restriction could be attached as a last-minute rider to a "must-pass" bill (e.g., a government funding bill), bypassing normal debate. This is a low-probability but possible scenario.
*   **Executive vs. Legislative Action:** The question specifies "US law." A presidential Executive Order might not qualify unless it is based on a clear statutory authority that imposes a legal restriction, which could be a legal gray area.
*   **Black Swan Event Dominance:** This forecast is highly sensitive to a low-probability, high-impact event (an AI catastrophe). The model is dominated by the "normal" state of affairs, but a single event could change everything overnight.

**Final Research Summary:** The historical precedent for placing a domestic cap on a general-purpose resource like compute is virtually non-existent. Given the powerful headwinds from legislative inertia, industry opposition, and geopolitical competition, and with less than two months remaining, the passage of such a law is exceptionally unlikely absent a paradigm-shifting catastrophe.

To forecast the probability of the US placing restrictions on the total compute capacity individuals or companies are allowed to have before 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate for the US government imposing quantitative domestic possession caps on general-purpose technology/resources is extremely low, likely less than 5% over a given two-year period. This is based on historical precedent, where the US has rarely placed hard caps on the total amount of a broadly available, economically vital resource or technology that a domestic company or individual can possess.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The current situation involves a general-purpose technology (compute) that is economically vital, similar to past cases where the US has avoided imposing hard caps.
   - Differences: The perceived existential stakes of AI and the concentration of resources in a few large corporations make this situation somewhat unique. However, these differences do not strongly suggest a higher probability of restrictions, given the historical context and current political climate.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **↓ (Large):** The timeline is very short (<2 months), making it nearly impossible to pass major, contentious legislation.
   - **↓ (Large):** There is no existing bill with compute caps that has momentum, and the legislative path is typically gridlocked.
   - **↓ (Moderate):** Recent market signals and policy discourse suggest low political energy for radical interventions.
   - **↓ (Moderate):** Unified industry opposition creates a significant barrier.
   - **↑ (Small):** Continued advocacy from the AI safety community represents a non-zero tail risk.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Starting with a prior probability of 5%, the overwhelming evidence against the likelihood of such legislation passing suggests a significant downward revision.
   - Posterior odds = Prior odds × Likelihood ratio
   - Given the strong evidence against the event occurring, the posterior probability is revised downward to reflect the low likelihood.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Consideration of tail risks, such as a sudden AI catastrophe, could change the landscape, but these are low-probability events.
   - An alternative forecast might consider a slightly higher probability if there were signs of a major legislative push or a significant AI-related incident, but current evidence does not support this.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Based on the base rate, evidence evaluation, and Bayesian updating, the final forecast reflects a very low probability of the event occurring.

Final: 1%

# Will the US place restrictions on the total compute capacity individuals or companies are allowed to have before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to identify an appropriate base rate for the US placing restrictions on total compute capacity before 2026 (within the next ~2 months).

The most relevant reference class is "US Government imposing quantitative domestic possession caps on general-purpose technology/resources." Historically, the US government has rarely placed hard caps on the total amount of broadly available, economically vital resources that domestic entities can possess. Regulation typically focuses on use (nuclear materials), safety standards (pharmaceuticals), or exports (advanced semiconductors), not on domestic accumulation limits.

Looking at similar cases:
- The US has never placed caps on electricity usage, steel production capacity, or general computing resources
- Even during wartime or crises, the approach has been incentives, not hard caps
- When regulation does occur for new technologies, it typically takes years to develop after initial concerns

Given these considerations, I'll set a very low prior of **3%** for this unprecedented type of economic intervention occurring within the next two months.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Computing resources remain a fundamental economic input like electricity or steel
- The US regulatory system still requires lengthy processes for major new regulations
- Industry opposition to restrictive regulation remains powerful
- Geopolitical competition with China creates strong incentives against hampering US tech companies

**Differences from base case:**
- AI is perceived by some as an existential risk, unlike most previously regulated technologies
- The required compute for frontier models is concentrated in a few large corporations
- AI capabilities are advancing rapidly, creating a sense of urgency
- The dual-use nature of compute makes it fundamentally different from regulating specific end-products

While these differences are notable, they don't fundamentally alter the extremely low likelihood of such a dramatic regulatory shift occurring in the next two months.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Key evidence:**

1. **Timeline constraint (less than 2 months until 2026)**
   - P(E|H): 0.05 - If restrictions were to be implemented, it would be extremely unlikely to happen in the next 2 months
   - P(E|~H): 0.99 - If restrictions won't be implemented, it's very likely we'd see this timeline constraint
   - Likelihood ratio: 0.05/0.99 = 0.05
   - This strongly decreases the probability

2. **Lack of existing legislative momentum**
   - P(E|H): 0.1 - If restrictions were coming, we'd expect to see bills with compute cap language already in process
   - P(E|~H): 0.95 - If restrictions aren't coming, we'd expect to see no such bills
   - Likelihood ratio: 0.1/0.95 = 0.11
   - This strongly decreases the probability

3. **Recent policy focus on transparency/liability rather than compute caps**
   - P(E|H): 0.2 - If restrictions were coming, we might still see other approaches discussed
   - P(E|~H): 0.9 - If restrictions aren't coming, we'd expect focus on other regulatory approaches
   - Likelihood ratio: 0.2/0.9 = 0.22
   - This moderately decreases the probability

4. **Unified industry opposition**
   - P(E|H): 0.3 - If restrictions were coming, we might see this despite opposition
   - P(E|~H): 0.9 - If restrictions aren't coming, industry opposition would be a contributing factor
   - Likelihood ratio: 0.3/0.9 = 0.33
   - This moderately decreases the probability

5. **Continued advocacy from AI safety community**
   - P(E|H): 0.8 - If restrictions were coming, we'd expect to see such advocacy
   - P(E|~H): 0.7 - If restrictions aren't coming, we'd still likely see such advocacy
   - Likelihood ratio: 0.8/0.7 = 1.14
   - This slightly increases the probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior of 3% (odds of 3:97 or about 1:32):

First update (timeline constraint):
- Prior odds: 0.03/0.97 = 0.031
- Likelihood ratio: 0.05
- Posterior odds: 0.031 × 0.05 = 0.00155
- Posterior probability: 0.00155/(1 + 0.00155) = 0.0015 or 0.15%

Second update (lack of legislative momentum):
- Prior odds: 0.0015/0.9985 = 0.0015
- Likelihood ratio: 0.11
- Posterior odds: 0.0015 × 0.11 = 0.000165
- Posterior probability: 0.000165/(1 + 0.000165) = 0.00016 or 0.016%

The remaining evidence would further reduce this already tiny probability, with only the continued advocacy providing a slight counterbalance. However, the probability is already so low that further explicit calculations would not meaningfully change the result.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I might be underestimating the possibility of emergency executive action in response to a sudden crisis
- There could be classified information or private discussions among policymakers that aren't publicly visible
- A compute cap could be attached as a rider to must-pass legislation like a government funding bill
- The definition of "restrictions" could be interpreted broadly to include indirect measures

**Alternative scenarios:**
- A major AI-related security incident occurs in the next month, creating sudden political will for emergency measures
- A voluntary industry agreement is formalized into a legal framework with government enforcement
- A narrowly-targeted restriction affecting only specific applications (e.g., bioweapon design) is implemented

Even considering these scenarios, the timeline constraint is overwhelming. The US legislative and regulatory process simply doesn't move fast enough to implement such a novel restriction in less than two months without an unprecedented crisis.

Given the Manifold market showing 1.5%, I should consider whether I'm being too confident in my extremely low probability. However, I believe the market may be overestimating the likelihood given the extremely short timeframe remaining.

## 6. Final Forecast

After considering the base rate, the specific evidence, and potential blind spots, I assess that the probability of the US placing restrictions on total compute capacity before 2026 is extremely low. The combination of legislative inertia, the short timeframe, lack of existing momentum, and powerful opposing interests makes this outcome highly unlikely.

Final: 0.5%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most appropriate reference class is the historical frequency of the US government imposing a quantitative cap on the domestic possession of a general-purpose, economically vital resource or technology. Historically, this is exceptionally rare. Regulations typically focus on use, safety, environmental impact, or exports, not on placing a hard limit on how much a domestic entity can own. Examples include steel, electricity, or server farms, none of which have possession caps. The base rate for such an unprecedented economic intervention over a ~2.5 year period is extremely low.

*   **Prior Probability P(H):** I will set the prior at **3%**. This acknowledges the novelty and perceived high stakes of AI, which make such a regulation more plausible than for historical technologies, while still reflecting its fundamental rarity. In odds, this is 3:97, or approximately 1:32.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
*   **Similarities:** Compute is a foundational economic input, and restricting it would face immense political and economic headwinds, just as restricting steel or electricity would. Powerful industry lobbying and arguments about ceding geopolitical advantage (especially to China) are strong, predictable forces against such a law.
*   **Differences:**
    1.  **Perceived Existential Risk:** A vocal and influential minority argues that advanced AI poses a unique, potentially existential threat, which could justify unprecedented government action. This increases the probability relative to the base case.
    2.  **Resource Concentration:** The immense compute required for frontier models is concentrated among a few large tech companies. This makes the regulatory target small and identifiable, which can make regulation seem more politically feasible.
    3.  **Pace of Development:** The rapid advancement of AI capabilities creates a sense of urgency that could, in theory, shorten the typically slow legislative process.

These differences suggest that the historical base rate should be treated as a soft anchor, as the current situation has unique drivers that could lead to a different outcome. However, the fundamental barriers of legislative inertia and economic disruption remain powerful.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
The most crucial piece of evidence is the date: November 1, 2025. The question resolves on December 31, 2025, leaving less than two months.

*   **Evidence 1: Extremely Short Timeline (<2 months remaining).**
    *   P(E | H): The probability of a major, contentious, and novel piece of legislation being introduced and passed in under two months is exceedingly low. For this to happen, it would almost certainly require an extraordinary catalyst or a pre-existing legislative vehicle.
    *   P(E | ~H): The probability of being in this situation if no law is passed is very high. This is the default state of legislative gridlock.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Very strongly favors ~H (the event not happening). This is the most powerful piece of evidence.

*   **Evidence 2: Focus of Current Policy Efforts (NIST Framework, Draft Senate Bill).**
    *   Recent policy drafts and frameworks focus on "soft" governance like transparency, watermarking, and liability reform, with no mention of compute caps.
    *   P(E | H): If a compute cap law were imminent, we would expect it to be a central topic in major policy discussions. Its absence is telling.
    *   P(E | ~H): This is exactly the expected state of affairs if the political consensus is forming around less drastic measures.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Strongly favors ~H.

*   **Evidence 3: Unified Industry Opposition and Geopolitical Concerns.**
    *   Tech CEOs have testified that caps would cripple US innovation. This is a powerful political argument.
    *   P(E | H): For a law to pass, this powerful opposition would have to be overcome, which is difficult.
    *   P(E | ~H): This opposition is expected and helps maintain the status quo.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Moderately favors ~H.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
*   **Prior Odds:** 1:32 (3% probability).
*   **Updating with Evidence:** The combined evidence overwhelmingly points against the event. The likelihood ratio from the short timeline alone is extremely small. For instance, if the chance of a bill passing in the final two months (without prior momentum) is 1/50th of the chance in other periods, the likelihood ratio would be ~0.02.
*   **Conceptual Update:**
    *   Posterior Odds = Prior Odds × (LR_timeline) × (LR_policy_focus) × (LR_industry)
    *   Posterior Odds ≈ (1:32) × (very small) × (small) × (small)
*   The result is a posterior probability that is significantly lower than the initial 3% prior, pushing it well under 1%. The evidence strongly reinforces the low base rate.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My analysis concludes the probability is very low. What could make this wrong?

*   **Alternative Scenario 1: Black Swan Event.** A catastrophic AI-related event occurs in November or December 2025 (e.g., a massive cyberattack, market crash, or disinformation campaign clearly linked to a new AI model). This could create a political panic, leading to emergency legislation. A compute cap, previously off the table, could be seen as the only effective "emergency brake."
*   **Alternative Scenario 2: Rider on a Must-Pass Bill.** A provision for compute caps could be attached to a critical, must-pass bill like an omnibus spending package or a defense authorization act. This would bypass normal debate. While industry lobbyists would likely detect and fight this, it remains a plausible, low-probability pathway for controversial legislation.
*   **Re-evaluating the Probability:** My initial update drives the probability to near-zero. However, these "tail risk" scenarios are not impossible. The Manifold market is at 1.5%, suggesting the community assigns some weight to these possibilities. The probability is not zero. A catastrophic event followed by a panicked legislative response is the most plausible path. I will estimate the probability of this specific sequence:
    *   P(Catastrophe in next 2 months) ≈ 5% (a high-end guess)
    *   P(Legislative response is a compute cap | Catastrophe) ≈ 10% (it's one of many possible responses)
    *   This path yields a probability of 5% * 10% = 0.5%.
    *   Adding a small probability for the "secret rider" scenario (e.g., another 0.5%) brings the total tail risk to around 1%.

This red-teaming exercise suggests that while the "normal circumstances" probability is near-zero, the tail risks from abnormal scenarios justify a forecast around 1%.

### 6. Final Forecast
The base rate for this type of law is extremely low. The available evidence, especially the very short time remaining before the resolution date and the lack of any legislative momentum, overwhelmingly suggests the event will not happen. The probability through normal legislative channels is negligible. The only remaining possibility is a low-probability "black swan" event that triggers an emergency legislative response or a successful "rider" attached to a must-pass bill. I assess the combined probability of these tail-risk scenarios to be approximately 1%.

Final: 1%
