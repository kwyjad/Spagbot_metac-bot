### **Research Plan**

**1. Core Questions to Investigate:**
*   **Q1: What was the pre-2020 baseline?** How prevalent was 24/7 service at Walmart before the pandemic, and what was its strategic purpose?
*   **Q2: What were the specific reasons for the change?** Beyond the initial COVID-19 trigger, what are the enduring financial, operational, and security reasons for maintaining reduced hours?
*   **Q3: What is Walmart's current corporate strategy?** Does it align with or conflict with a return to 24/7 in-store service? Specifically, how do investments in e-commerce, automation, and delivery services affect the calculus?
*   **Q4: What is the status of the key barriers?** Has the situation regarding labor costs/availability and retail theft improved or worsened since Walmart's 2022 statement?
*   **Q5: Are there any leading indicators of a change?** Have there been any recent pilot programs, executive statements, or shifts in competitor behavior that suggest a move back toward 24/7 service?
*   **Q6: What is the logistical feasibility?** Given the resolution date of January 1, 2026, and a current date of November 21, 2025, what is the realistic timeline for implementing such a massive operational change across a "majority" of stores?

**2. Search Queries:**
*   **Q1:** "Walmart 24/7 stores pre-covid", "Walmart supercenter hours history"
*   **Q2:** "Walmart reasons for ending 24-hour service", "Walmart CEO on store hours", "profitability of overnight retail hours"
*   **Q3:** "Walmart investor day 2024 2025 summary", "Walmart corporate strategy e-commerce", "Walmart automation supply chain investment"
*   **Q4:** "retail labor costs US 2025", "organized retail crime statistics 2024 2025", "Walmart shrink rate"
*   **Q5:** "Walmart extending store hours 2025", "Walmart pilot program 24/7", "Target Kroger store hours 2025"
*   **Q6:** "large retail chain operational change timeline", "logistics of changing nationwide store hours"

**3. Synthesis of Findings:**
The pre-2020 norm of 24/7 service at most Walmart Supercenters was a key competitive differentiator. However, the pandemic provided a natural experiment, forcing a shutdown of overnight hours. Walmart discovered this was a significant cost-saving measure, reducing expenses related to labor, utilities, and security. The official statement in 2022 cited labor shortages, but the enduring drivers appear to be profitability and risk mitigation. The current strategic focus, as evidenced by investor calls and press releases, is heavily skewed towards e-commerce, automation, and delivery services (like InHome and drone delivery), which serve the 24/7 convenience niche without the costs and risks of keeping physical stores open. Furthermore, the problem of retail theft ("shrink") has escalated dramatically since 2020, making overnight operations a much greater security and financial liability than before. There is no evidence of pilot programs or executive interest in returning to 24/7; in fact, some stores have further reduced hours in high-crime areas. Competitors have also maintained reduced hours, creating no pressure for Walmart to change. Finally, the logistical challenge of hiring, training, and re-orienting operations for a majority of ~4,700 US stores in the ~6 weeks remaining before the deadline is practically insurmountable.

**4. Draft Comprehensive Answer.**

---

### Reference class & base rates
*   **Major US retailers' post-pandemic operational models:** The vast majority of national retail chains (e.g., Target, Home Depot, major grocery chains) that reduced hours during the COVID-19 pandemic have made those changes permanent. The base rate of a major retailer reverting to a pre-2020 24/7 model is extremely low, likely <5%. This reflects a sector-wide realization that overnight hours are often unprofitable.
*   **Walmart's major, unannounced strategic reversals:** Large corporations like Walmart plan major operational shifts (e.g., automation rollout, store redesigns) quarters or years in advance. The base rate of Walmart implementing a massive, costly, and unannounced strategic reversal in under two months is near 0%.
*   **Large-scale operational changes in retail:** Implementing a fundamental change in operating hours across thousands of locations requires significant lead time for hiring, training, security adjustments, and supply chain logistics. The base rate for such a change being completed nationwide within a 6-week window is effectively 0%.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   [2025-11-20] Walmart's Q3 FY26 report shows a 28% jump in U.S. e-commerce sales. (↓) — This reinforces that the company's growth engine is digital, which directly substitutes for and disincentivizes costly 24/7 physical store operations.
*   [2024-05-21] In its Q1 FY25 earnings call, Walmart executives highlighted "strong growth in delivery" and store-fulfilled pickup as key drivers. (↓) — Continued emphasis on digital and convenience channels shows strategic priorities lie outside of extending physical store hours.
*   [2024-02-20] Walmart announced plans to build or convert more than 150 stores over the next five years, emphasizing modern, digitally-enabled designs. (↔/↓) — The focus is on store quality and digital integration, not hours. New investments are unlikely to target a low-margin, high-risk operating model.
*   [2023-09-28] Walmart's CEO John Furner stated that theft is at "historic highs" and that if it doesn't get corrected, "prices will be higher, and/or stores will close." (↓) — This highlights a severe and worsening security environment, making the prospect of re-opening stores during the most vulnerable overnight hours extremely unlikely.
*   [2023-08-12] The company's 2022 statement that it has "no plans" to return to 24/7 service remains the last official, direct communication on the topic. (↓) — The lack of any subsequent statement retracting or modifying this position is strong evidence of a stable strategy.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **Profitability and Margin Protection (Large ↓):** Overnight hours have high marginal costs (labor premiums, security, utilities) and serve a small customer base, resulting in low profitability. Eliminating them was a permanent cost-saving measure that Walmart is unlikely to reverse.
*   **Organized Retail Crime & Security Costs (Large ↓):** The significant, well-documented increase in retail theft makes overnight hours a massive liability. The cost of securing stores and the potential losses from theft far outweigh the minimal revenue from overnight shoppers.
*   **Strategic Focus on E-commerce & Delivery (Large ↓):** Walmart is competing with Amazon. Its multi-billion dollar investments in automation, fulfillment centers, and delivery services (Walmart+, InHome) are designed to provide 24/7 convenience digitally, making 24/7 physical access redundant.
*   **Shift in Consumer Behavior (Moderate ↓):** The pandemic broke the 24/7 shopping habit for many consumers, who have now adapted to reduced hours or shifted to online ordering for late-night needs. The demand for overnight in-store shopping has likely decreased permanently.
*   **Labor Management (Moderate ↓):** While acute labor shortages have eased since 2022, staffing overnight shifts remains challenging and expensive. Maintaining reduced hours simplifies scheduling and reduces labor costs.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Revealed Preference:** Unlike a temporary disruption, the pandemic was a multi-year natural experiment that revealed the 24/7 model was less profitable than previously assumed. The "new normal" is a deliberate, data-driven strategic choice, not a lingering crisis response.
*   **Heightened Security Risks:** The current environment of organized retail crime is structurally different and more severe than the pre-2020 environment, fundamentally altering the risk/reward calculation for overnight operations.
*   **Mature Digital Alternatives:** Walmart

To forecast whether Walmart stores in the United States will return to 24-hour service before 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Base Rate:** The base rate for major US retailers reverting to a pre-2020 24/7 model is extremely low, likely <5%. This is based on the observation that most national retail chains have made reduced hours permanent post-pandemic. Additionally, the base rate for Walmart implementing a massive, costly, and unannounced strategic reversal in under two months is near 0%.
- **Initial Prior:** Given these considerations, the initial prior probability is set at 5%.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** The current situation aligns with the base case where retailers have permanently reduced hours due to cost savings and operational efficiencies.
- **Differences:** The heightened security risks and strategic focus on e-commerce and delivery services further reduce the likelihood of reverting to 24/7 operations.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Evidence 1:** Walmart's Q3 FY26 report shows a 28% jump in U.S. e-commerce sales. This suggests a strategic focus on digital channels, decreasing the likelihood of returning to 24/7 physical store operations. (Likelihood ratio < 1)
- **Evidence 2:** Walmart's CEO highlighted historic highs in theft, making overnight operations a liability. This further decreases the likelihood. (Likelihood ratio < 1)
- **Evidence 3:** No evidence of pilot programs or executive interest in returning to 24/7 service. (Likelihood ratio < 1)

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
- **Prior Odds:** 5% probability translates to odds of 0.05 / 0.95 = 0.0526.
- **Likelihood Ratio:** Given the evidence, the likelihood ratio is significantly less than 1, suggesting a decrease in probability.
- **Posterior Odds:** Prior odds × Likelihood ratio = 0.0526 × (much less than 1) = significantly reduced odds.
- **Posterior Probability:** The posterior probability is calculated from the reduced odds, resulting in a probability much lower than the initial 5%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** The forecast considers multiple pieces of evidence and aligns with industry trends, reducing overconfidence.
- **Tail Risks:** Consideration of a sudden strategic shift or external pressure (e.g., competitor actions) is unlikely given the current evidence.
- **Alternative Forecast:** A plausible alternative could involve a partial return to 24/7 service in select locations, but this would not meet the criteria for a majority of stores.

### 6. Final Forecast
- **Final Probability:** Considering the base rate, evidence, and Bayesian updating, the final forecast probability is significantly lower than the initial prior.

Final: 1%

# Will Walmart stores in the United States return to 24-hour service before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to establish a base rate for major retailers reverting to pre-pandemic operating hours, specifically 24/7 service.

**Relevant base rates:**
- Major US retailers that reduced hours during COVID-19 and later reverted to 24/7 service: Very few if any major chains have fully reverted to pre-pandemic 24/7 models.
- Walmart's history of major operational reversals: Walmart typically implements strategic changes gradually, with extensive planning and piloting.
- Large-scale operational changes across thousands of retail locations: These typically require 6-12+ months of planning and implementation.

Given these considerations, I'll use a prior probability of 5%. This is likely generous, as there are virtually no examples of major retailers returning to 24/7 service post-pandemic, but I want to avoid starting with an extremely low prior.

**Prior probability: 5%** (19:1 odds against)

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Walmart is still operating under the reduced-hours model established during the pandemic
- The retail sector as a whole has maintained reduced operating hours
- Labor markets have somewhat normalized since the acute pandemic shortages

**Key differences:**
- We are now in late November 2025, with only about 5-6 weeks until the resolution date (January 1, 2026)
- Walmart has had over 5 years to revert to 24/7 service but has chosen not to do so
- The company has invested heavily in e-commerce and delivery services that provide 24/7 access without physical stores being open
- Retail theft has reportedly increased significantly since pre-pandemic times
- Consumer shopping habits have adapted to the new hours

These differences significantly reduce the likelihood compared to the base rate, as the time constraint alone makes implementation before 2026 nearly impossible.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Walmart's 2022 statement of "no plans" to return to 24/7 service**
- P(E|H): If Walmart were planning to return to 24/7 service before 2026, it's unlikely they would have made such a definitive statement without qualification. ~0.2
- P(E|~H): If Walmart is not returning to 24/7 service, this statement aligns perfectly. ~0.9
- Likelihood ratio: 0.2/0.9 = 0.22 (strong evidence against)

**Evidence 2: Continued investment in e-commerce and delivery (28% jump in US e-commerce in Q3 FY26)**
- P(E|H): If planning to return to 24/7 physical operations, Walmart might still invest in e-commerce, but perhaps not as heavily. ~0.5
- P(E|~H): If committed to the current model, heavy investment in digital alternatives makes perfect sense. ~0.9
- Likelihood ratio: 0.5/0.9 = 0.56 (moderate evidence against)

**Evidence 3: Reported increases in retail theft and security concerns**
- P(E|H): If planning to return to 24/7 service, Walmart would need to have solutions for these security issues. ~0.3
- P(E|~H): If maintaining reduced hours, these security concerns provide strong justification. ~0.8
- Likelihood ratio: 0.3/0.8 = 0.38 (moderate evidence against)

**Evidence 4: No announcements or pilot programs for extended hours as of November 2025**
- P(E|H): If planning to implement 24/7 service within weeks, we would almost certainly see announcements, hiring initiatives, or pilot programs. ~0.05
- P(E|~H): If not planning to change, we would expect silence on this issue. ~0.95
- Likelihood ratio: 0.05/0.95 = 0.05 (very strong evidence against)

**Evidence 5: Logistical constraints of implementing nationwide change in ~5-6 weeks**
- P(E|H): If returning to 24/7 service, Walmart would need to overcome enormous logistical challenges in an extremely short timeframe. ~0.01
- P(E|~H): If not changing, these constraints are irrelevant. ~1.0
- Likelihood ratio: 0.01/1.0 = 0.01 (extremely strong evidence against)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 5:95 (or 1:19):

**Update on Evidence 4 (No announcements or pilot programs):**
Posterior odds = 1/19 × 0.05 = 1/380
Posterior probability = 1/(1+380) ≈ 0.26%

**Update on Evidence 5 (Logistical constraints):**
Posterior odds = 1/380 × 0.01 = 1/38,000
Posterior probability = 1/(1+38,000) ≈ 0.003%

Even if I were to be extremely conservative and only update on these two strongest pieces of evidence, the probability becomes vanishingly small. The time constraint alone makes this virtually impossible.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I might be underestimating Walmart's operational capabilities to implement rapid change
- There could be secret pilot programs or plans not yet public
- Walmart might define "return to 24-hour service" differently than expected (e.g., only certain departments)

**Alternative scenarios:**
- Walmart could announce a limited rollout to a small subset of stores before January 1, 2026
- They might implement extended holiday hours that technically qualify as 24/7 for a brief period

**Best alternative forecast:**
The most plausible alternative is that Walmart has been secretly planning this change for months and will announce it imminently. However, even this scenario faces the enormous challenge of hiring and training overnight staff for thousands of stores in a matter of weeks during the holiday season.

After considering these alternatives, I still find the probability extremely low, but will adjust slightly upward from the calculated 0.003% to account for unknown factors and the possibility of surprise announcements.

## 6. Final Forecast

Given the extremely short timeframe before resolution (5-6 weeks), the complete absence of any signals suggesting a return to 24/7 service, Walmart's continued investment in alternative convenience channels, and the enormous logistical challenges involved, I assess the probability as extremely low.

While my Bayesian calculation yielded a probability of approximately 0.003%, I will adjust this slightly upward to account for unknown factors and to avoid excessive precision.

Final: 0.1%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

*   **Reference Class:** The most relevant reference class is major US retail chains that reduced their operating hours during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. This class includes companies like Target, Kroger, Home Depot, and Walmart itself.
*   **Base Rate Calculation:** Before 2020, 24/7 operation was a key feature for some retailers, notably Walmart Supercenters. After the pandemic forced widespread hour reductions, virtually none of these major chains have reverted to a 24/7 model. The industry as a whole has discovered significant cost savings (labor, security, utilities) and has shifted to serving late-night demand through e-commerce and delivery. The rate of reversion to 24/7 operations in this reference class is extremely low, arguably close to 0%.
*   **Initial Prior:** A generous prior probability, P(H), for a major retailer making such a significant and costly strategic reversal against the industry trend would be around **5%**. This translates to prior odds of 1:19 against the event.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities:** Walmart is a data-driven, profit-maximizing entity, just like the other retailers in the reference class. The pandemic served as a "natural experiment," revealing that the high costs of overnight operations might not be justified by the revenue they generate.
*   **Differences:**
    *   **Brand Identity:** Being "always open" was more central to Walmart's brand than to its competitors. This could create a slightly stronger internal argument for returning to 24/7 service than for the average retailer. This factor might slightly increase the probability.
    *   **Timeline Constraint:** The most critical difference is the resolution date. The question asks if this will happen before January 1, 2026. As of late November 2025, this leaves an extremely short window of about six weeks. Implementing a massive operational change—hiring and training tens of thousands of staff, adjusting security and logistics—across a "majority" (over 2,350) of its US stores in such a short period is a monumental undertaking. This logistical constraint makes the event far less likely than a generic reversal over a multi-year period.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

Let H be the hypothesis that "Walmart returns to 24/7 service before 2026."

*   **Evidence 1: Stated Corporate Strategy & E-commerce Focus.** Walmart's executives have consistently emphasized growth in e-commerce, delivery (Walmart+), and automated fulfillment. Their Q3 FY26 report (Nov 2025) showed a 28% jump in e-commerce sales.
    *   P(E | H): It is highly unlikely that Walmart would heavily invest in a digital 24/7 strategy while simultaneously planning a return to a costly physical 24/7 model. The two strategies are substitutes, not complements.
    *   P(E | ~H): This evidence is perfectly consistent with Walmart having no plans to reopen stores 24/7, as they are building a digital alternative.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Very low (< 0.1). This evidence strongly **decreases** the probability.

*   **Evidence 2: Escalation of Organized Retail Crime.** Walmart's CEO has publicly stated that theft is at "historic highs" and is a threat to store viability.
    *   P(E | H): It is almost inconceivable that management would choose to reopen stores during the most vulnerable overnight hours amidst a widely acknowledged security crisis. This would dramatically increase both security costs and losses from theft ("shrink").
    *   P(E | ~H): High theft provides a powerful financial and safety incentive to keep stores closed overnight.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Extremely low (<< 0.1). This evidence **dramatically decreases** the probability.

*   **Evidence 3: The Short Timeline.** The resolution requires the change to be *implemented* in a majority of stores within the next ~6 weeks.
    *   P(E | H): For the event to happen, a massive, nationwide hiring and operational rollout would need to be completed in under two months, with no prior public announcement or visible preparation. The logistical probability of this is virtually zero.
    *   P(E | ~H): It is virtually certain that such a change would *not* happen on this timeline if it were not already well underway.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Effectively zero. This is the most decisive piece of evidence.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)

*   **Initial State:** We start with a low prior of 5% (odds of 1:19).
*   **Updating Step:** Each piece of evidence provides a strong multiplicative update downwards. The strategic focus on e-commerce and the retail theft crisis would each independently push the probability down significantly.
*   **Final Update (Timeline):** The final piece of evidence—the impossibly short timeline—is the most powerful. Even if we ignored all other evidence and assumed Walmart *wanted* to do this, the logistical feasibility of achieving it in six weeks is near zero.
    *   Posterior Odds = Prior Odds × LR(Strategy) × LR(Theft) × LR(Timeline)
    *   Posterior Odds ≈ (1/19) × (very small) × (very small) × (near zero)
*   The result is a posterior probability that is vanishingly small. The combination of strategic direction, financial incentives, risk aversion, and logistical impossibility creates an overwhelming case against the event occurring.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

*   **Alternative Scenario:** Could there be a massive, pre-planned holiday surprise announcement and rollout? This would be a PR stunt of epic proportions. However, it defies all business logic. The costs would be immense, and the required hiring would have been noticed. Furthermore, the resolution requires the change to be *in effect*, not just announced.
*   **Could I be overconfident?** The primary driver of the extremely low probability is the timeline. If the question were "before 2028," the probability would be higher (perhaps 5-10%), as strategy can change. But for a "before 2026" resolution, the logistical constraints are a near-insurmountable barrier. The confluence of all evidence pointing in the same direction reduces the chance of being wrong due to a single flawed assumption. The 1% forecast on Metaculus suggests this strong skepticism is shared by the forecasting community.
*   **Final Check:** The forecast should not be 0%, as that implies absolute certainty. A 1% chance is reserved for scenarios that are not physically impossible but would require a chain of events that are all individually extremely unlikely and run contrary to all available evidence. This situation fits that description.

### 6. Final Forecast

The initial base rate is low, and every significant piece of evidence—corporate strategy, financial incentives, the security environment, and especially the extremely short logistical timeline—points strongly in the same direction, reducing the probability further. The operational challenge of implementing this change across a majority of US stores in the approximately six weeks remaining is practically insurmountable.

Final: 1%
