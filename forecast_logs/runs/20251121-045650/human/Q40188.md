### Reference class & base rates
1.  **U.S. Agricultural Import Suspensions for Major Animal Diseases:** The U.S. frequently imposes temporary bans on animal products from regions experiencing outbreaks of diseases like Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD), Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), or Avian Influenza. The duration of these bans varies significantly based on the disease's severity, transmission risk, and the exporting country's ability to control it.
    *   **Base Rate/Reasoning:** Durations range from a few months to over a decade (e.g., the UK BSE ban). A more typical duration for a containable, non-zoonotic (to the same degree as BSE) disease where the partner country is cooperative is 6-18 months. The current NWS suspension began in May 2025 (reimposed in July), placing it at 4-6 months duration so far. A resolution before Jan 1, 2026 (~7-8 months total) would be on the faster side of this reference class but not unprecedented. Ballpark base rate for resolution within 8 months: **25-40%**.
    *   **Limitations:** This class is very broad. NWS is not like BSE; it is insect-vectored and has a well-established eradication method (Sterile Insect Technique - SIT), which may allow for a faster, more verifiable resolution.

2.  **Historical New World Screwworm (NWS) Eradication Campaigns:** The original U.S. NWS eradication program took years (1957-1966). Subsequent efforts to push the barrier south through Mexico and Central America were also multi-year campaigns.
    *   **Base Rate/Reasoning:** These campaigns aimed for total eradication over vast territories. The current goal is not full eradication in Mexico but demonstrating sufficient control near the border to allow trade. Still, these campaigns show that progress is measured in months and years, not weeks. The base rate for achieving a significant milestone (like border reopening) in under a year of focused effort is low. Ballpark base rate based on this class: **<10%**.
    *   **Limitations:** Modern technology, existing infrastructure (the Panama plant), and a more focused geographic goal (protecting the border) make this situation different from the initial continent-wide eradication efforts.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-11-14** USDA announces $109.8M investment and a shift in sterile fly dispersal to Mexico, the northernmost point of the outbreak. ↑ — Signals a massive, high-priority U.S. commitment to solving the problem *in Mexico*, a prerequisite for reopening.
*   **2025-11-13** A new, U.S.-supported sterile fly dispersal facility opens in Tampico, Mexico, to cover the northeastern part of the country. ↑↑ — This is a major operational development. It moves from planning/agreement to direct, large-scale action in the most critical region for U.S. imports.
*   **2025-11-04** USDA Secretary states "no time frame for reopening" but is "pleased with Mexico's efforts" and that "every day...we get a little bit closer." ↑ — Cautiously optimistic political signal. Acknowledges progress while managing expectations, but the tone is positive, not punitive.
*   **2025-10-07** A second NWS case is confirmed in Nuevo León, in a calf transported from a southern state. ↓↓ — Reinforces the risk of northward movement and the justification for the ban. Highlights that internal Mexican cattle movement controls are a key vulnerability.
*   **2025-09-22** First NWS case confirmed in Nuevo León, ~70 miles from the U.S. border. ↓↓ — The most significant negative event. It brought the threat from a distant problem in southern Mexico to an immediate cross-border risk, resetting the clock on any potential reopening.
*   **2025-06-XX** A plane carrying sterile flies crashed in southern Mexico. ↓ — A logistical and operational setback that likely slowed eradication momentum during a critical period.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Effectiveness of Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) Dispersal:** The core of the eradication effort. The new Tampico facility's ability to saturate northeastern Mexico with sterile flies is the primary mechanism for driving NWS cases down. **(Large impact)**
2.  **U.S. Bureaucratic Risk Aversion (APHIS/USDA):** The USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) will not reopen the border until it has high confidence the risk is mitigated. This requires a sustained period (likely several NWS life cycles, i.e., multiple weeks to months) of zero new detections in the border region. This acts as a powerful brake. **(Large impact)**
3.  **U.S.-Mexico Political & Technical Cooperation:** The high level of cooperation, including U.S. funding for facilities in Mexico, accelerates progress. Any breakdown in this relationship would halt progress. **(Moderate impact)**
4.  **Economic Pressure:** Mexico is losing a major export market. U.S. cattle producers, particularly in border states, rely on Mexican feeder cattle. This creates strong incentives on both sides to find a solution quickly, but it is unlikely to override APHIS's phytosanitary risk assessment. **(Moderate impact)**
5.  **Mexico's Internal Livestock Controls:** The recent cases in Nuevo León came from southern Mexico. Mexico's ability to control and trace animal movements internally is a key variable in preventing re-introduction to northern states, even as SIT efforts progress. **(Moderate impact)**

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Extremely Short Time Horizon:** The question resolves in ~40 days. This is a very short window for a risk-averse bureaucracy to observe success, verify it, and enact a policy change, especially over the U.S. holiday season (Thanksgiving to New Year's).
*   **Unprecedented U.S. Investment on Foreign Soil:** The U.S. is not just waiting for Mexico to fix the problem; it is actively funding and building eradication infrastructure within Mexico. This level of partnership is unusual compared to typical trade/disease disputes and suggests a stronger, faster path to resolution than the base rate might imply.
*   **Proximity of Threat:** Unlike a BSE outbreak an ocean away, this threat is directly on the land border. The September/October cases in Nuevo León make the risk of re-infestation in the U.S. palpable and immediate, justifying a higher-than-usual level of caution from APHIS.
*   **Proven Eradication Technology:** The problem is not scientific discovery; it is the logistical and political challenge of deploying a known solution (SIT). This makes the problem more tractable than a novel disease, suggesting a potentially faster resolution if deployment is successful.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A prior starting near evens (e.g., 40% Yes), derived from the reference class of 6-18 month import bans, seems reasonable. The current ban is ~5 months old, so resolution in the next 1.5 months would be on the faster side but plausible.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑↑ Large) The Tampico sterile fly dispersal facility became operational in mid-November. This is the most significant positive development, as it is the primary tool to solve the underlying problem in the key geographic area.
    *   (↓ Large) The very short time horizon (~40 days) running into a major holiday season creates immense bureaucratic inertia. APHIS will require a sustained period of "no new cases" before acting, and this window may be too short to establish that track record.
    *   (↓ Moderate) Confirmed cases in Nuevo León (Sept/Oct) reset the clock by demonstrating the threat was at the doorstep, increasing the required level of evidence for APHIS to feel secure.
    *   (↑ Small) Positive statements from Secretary Rollins and high-level US-Mexico cooperation show political will, which can help accelerate bureaucratic processes, but is unlikely to override core risk assessment protocols.
*   **Net effect:** The powerful, positive operational news (Tampico facility) is fighting an even more powerful headwind of bureaucratic inertia and the need for a proven period of success over an extremely short, holiday-interrupted timeline. The net effect should be a significant downward revision of the prior.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Official APHIS/USDA press releases detailing a significant, sustained reduction in NWS detections in northeastern Mexican states.
    *   Statements from U.S. or Mexican officials explicitly mentioning a "pathway to reopening" or a "timeline for review."
    *   Reports of successful, widespread sterile fly dispersal from the new Tampico facility.
    *   Lobbying efforts from U.S. cattle industry groups claiming the risk is mitigated and calling for reopening.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Any new NWS case detected in the northern Mexican states of Nuevo León, Coahuila, or Tamaulipas.
    *   Reports of logistical problems with the sterile fly production or dispersal programs.
    *   Statements from USDA/APHIS officials emphasizing continued risk and the need for prolonged caution.
    *   Discovery of an NWS case within the United States, which would trigger a much larger domestic response and eliminate any chance of reopening.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Bureaucratic Black Box:** The precise APHIS criteria and internal timeline for lifting the suspension are not public. The decision process is opaque and driven by internal risk assessments.
*   **Holiday Slowdown:** The period between late November and January 1 is a time of reduced government operational tempo, making major policy changes less likely.
*   **Data Lag & Reliability:** There may be a lag in reporting of new NWS cases from Mexico. The reliability of surveillance data is a key uncertainty.
*   **Fictionalized Scenario:** The prompt uses a hypothetical timeline and a fictional USDA Secretary. While the dynamics are based on real-world possibilities, the specific events are not real, limiting the ability to cross-reference with real-time news.
*   **Resolution Ambiguity:** "Permitted to resume" could mean a full reopening or a limited, conditional one (e.g., only from certain certified regions). The latter is more likely and could happen faster, but the criteria should be watched closely.

**Final Research Summary:**
The U.S. and Mexico are mounting an aggressive, well-funded, and cooperative effort to control the NWS outbreak, with the recent opening of a key dispersal facility being a major positive step. However, the extremely short timeline for resolution (~40 days) combined with the institutional caution of APHIS following recent NWS detections near the border makes a full reopening before 2026 highly unlikely.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate for reopening cattle imports from Mexico within 8 months of suspension is estimated at 25-40%, based on historical U.S. agricultural import suspensions for major animal diseases. This is because the current suspension began in May 2025, and reopening by January 2026 would be on the faster side of typical durations for similar situations.
   - Initial prior probability: 30% (midpoint of 25-40%).

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The situation involves a disease outbreak (NWS) and a suspension of imports, similar to other historical cases.
   - Differences: The U.S. is actively involved in eradication efforts in Mexico, which is unusual and could expedite resolution. However, the proximity of recent cases to the U.S. border increases caution.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Tampico Facility Operational (↑↑ Large):** This development significantly increases the likelihood of controlling the outbreak, suggesting a higher probability of reopening. Likelihood ratio >1.
   - **Short Time Horizon (↓ Large):** The limited time before the end of 2025 and the holiday season reduce the likelihood of reopening. Likelihood ratio <1.
   - **Recent Cases in Nuevo León (↓ Moderate):** These cases increase caution and delay reopening. Likelihood ratio <1.
   - **Positive Statements from USDA (↑ Small):** Indicate progress but are unlikely to override risk assessments. Likelihood ratio slightly >1.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Prior odds = 0.3 / 0.7 = 0.4286
   - Likelihood ratio (combined effect of evidence) ≈ 0.5 (net effect of positive and negative evidence)
   - Posterior odds = 0.4286 × 0.5 = 0.2143
   - Posterior probability = 0.2143 / (1 + 0.2143) ≈ 0.1765 or 17.65%

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence risk: The short timeline and holiday season are significant barriers. The positive developments may not be sufficient to overcome these.
   - Alternative scenario: A rapid decrease in NWS cases and strong political pressure could lead to a faster reopening. However, this is less likely given the current evidence.
   - Adjustments: The probability remains low due to the strong negative factors.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Final probability reflects the base rate and the impact of evidence, considering the short timeline and bureaucratic caution.

Final: 18%

# Will the United States reopen cattle imports from Mexico before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to establish a base rate for how long agricultural import suspensions typically last, particularly for animal disease outbreaks near the US border.

Looking at historical cases of US agricultural import suspensions:
- Typical animal disease-related import bans last 6-18 months for containable diseases where the partner country is cooperative
- The current New World screwworm (NWS) suspension began in May 2025 (reimposed in July), so it's been about 4-6 months
- Resolution before January 1, 2026 would mean a total ban duration of 7-8 months

Based on this reference class, a reasonable prior would be around 30-35% that the ban will be lifted within this timeframe. This is on the faster side of typical resolutions but not unprecedented for a case where:
1. There's strong bilateral cooperation
2. The disease has known eradication methods
3. There are strong economic incentives on both sides

**Prior probability: 35%**

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- This is a standard agricultural import suspension due to animal disease risk
- The US and Mexico have strong trade relationships and economic incentives to resolve quickly
- The disease (NWS) has established eradication protocols (Sterile Insect Technique)

**Key differences:**
- **Extremely short remaining timeline**: Only about 40 days remain until the resolution date
- **Recent cases near border**: NWS was detected in Nuevo León in September/October 2025, just 70 miles from the US border
- **Unprecedented US investment**: The US is directly funding and building eradication infrastructure in Mexico
- **Holiday season**: The remaining period includes the US holiday season (Thanksgiving to New Year's), when government processes typically slow down

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Recent NWS cases in northern Mexico (September-October 2025)**
- P(E|H): If the border reopens before 2026, how likely would we see these cases? Low (0.2)
- P(E|~H): If the border remains closed, how likely would we see these cases? High (0.9)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.2/0.9 = 0.22
- This evidence significantly decreases the probability of reopening before 2026

**Evidence 2: New Tampico sterile fly dispersal facility opened (November 13, 2025)**
- P(E|H): If the border reopens before 2026, how likely would we see this facility open? Very high (0.9)
- P(E|~H): If the border remains closed, how likely would we see this facility open? Moderate (0.6)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.9/0.6 = 1.5
- This evidence moderately increases the probability of reopening before 2026

**Evidence 3: USDA Secretary's statement "no time frame for reopening" but "every day we get closer" (November 4, 2025)**
- P(E|H): If the border reopens before 2026, how likely would we hear this statement? Moderate (0.6)
- P(E|~H): If the border remains closed, how likely would we hear this statement? Moderate (0.5)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.6/0.5 = 1.2
- This evidence slightly increases the probability of reopening before 2026

**Evidence 4: $109.8M USDA investment in Mexico eradication efforts (November 14, 2025)**
- P(E|H): If the border reopens before 2026, how likely would we see this investment? High (0.8)
- P(E|~H): If the border remains closed, how likely would we see this investment? Moderate (0.5)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.8/0.5 = 1.6
- This evidence moderately increases the probability of reopening before 2026

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with the prior of 35% (odds of 0.54:1), let's update based on the evidence:

**Update on Evidence 1 (Recent NWS cases near border):**
- Prior odds: 0.54:1
- Likelihood ratio: 0.22
- Posterior odds: 0.54 × 0.22 = 0.12:1
- Posterior probability: 0.12/(1+0.12) = 10.7%

**Update on Evidence 2 (New Tampico facility):**
- Prior odds: 0.12:1
- Likelihood ratio: 1.5
- Posterior odds: 0.12 × 1.5 = 0.18:1
- Posterior probability: 0.18/(1+0.18) = 15.3%

**Update on Evidence 3 (USDA Secretary's statement):**
- Prior odds: 0.18:1
- Likelihood ratio: 1.2
- Posterior odds: 0.18 × 1.2 = 0.216:1
- Posterior probability: 0.216/(1+0.216) = 17.8%

**Update on Evidence 4 (USDA investment):**
- Prior odds: 0.216:1
- Likelihood ratio: 1.6
- Posterior odds: 0.216 × 1.6 = 0.346:1
- Posterior probability: 0.346/(1+0.346) = 25.7%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating bureaucratic inertia and the time required for APHIS to verify success
- The holiday season effect might be stronger than I've accounted for
- I might be overestimating the impact of the new Tampico facility, as it will take time to show results
- I haven't fully accounted for the risk of new NWS cases appearing in the next 40 days

**Alternative scenarios:**
- The US could implement a partial reopening for specific regions of Mexico that are certified NWS-free
- Political pressure from US cattle producers might accelerate the process more than expected
- The USDA might have internal metrics/timelines that are more optimistic than public statements suggest

**Best alternative forecast:**
A more optimistic view might put the probability at 40-45%, arguing that:
1. The massive US investment signals confidence in near-term resolution
2. Economic pressures are mounting on both sides
3. The Tampico facility could show immediate impact

However, this view underestimates:
1. The APHIS requirement for a sustained period (likely multiple NWS life cycles) of zero new detections
2. The extremely short timeline remaining (40 days)
3. The holiday season bureaucratic slowdown

Given these considerations, I need to adjust my forecast downward. The extremely short timeline combined with the need for verification of success over multiple NWS life cycles makes reopening before January 1, 2026 unlikely.

## 6. Final Forecast

After considering all evidence and counterarguments, I believe the probability of the US reopening cattle imports from Mexico before 2026 is approximately 20%. The recent positive developments (new facility, funding) are significant but are fighting against the extremely short timeline, the recent cases near the border, and the institutional caution of APHIS.

Final: 20%

Here is my probabilistic forecast reasoning:

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most appropriate reference class is the duration of past U.S. agricultural import suspensions for major animal diseases (e.g., BSE, FMD). These bans typically last from 6 to 18 months when the exporting country is cooperative and the disease is containable. The current suspension began in May 2025 and was reimposed in July 2025. A resolution before January 1, 2026, would place the total duration at approximately 7.5 months. This is on the faster side of the 6-18 month range. Therefore, a base rate slightly below 50% is warranted.

I will set the prior probability P(H) at **35%**. This reflects that a resolution within this timeframe is plausible but faster than average for this class of events. In prior odds, this is 0.35 / 0.65 ≈ 0.54.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
*   **Similarities:** The situation involves a risk-averse U.S. regulatory body (USDA/APHIS), significant economic pressure from industry on both sides of the border, and the need for the exporting country (Mexico) to demonstrate effective control measures.
*   **Differences:**
    *   **(Negative) Proximity:** The NWS threat is on a shared land border, unlike overseas diseases like BSE in the UK. This proximity increases the risk of re-infestation in the U.S., likely making regulators *more* cautious and extending the ban duration compared to the base case.
    *   **(Positive) Known Technology & U.S. Involvement:** The primary control method, the Sterile Insect Technique (SIT), is well-established. Crucially, the U.S. is not just observing; it is actively funding and co-operating on eradication efforts inside Mexico. This high level of partnership is unusual and a strong accelerator, suggesting a *faster* resolution than the base case.

These two major differences pull in opposite directions. The heightened risk argues for a lower probability, while the direct U.S. intervention argues for a higher one. I will treat them as roughly balancing, leaving the initial prior of 35% unchanged for now.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will evaluate key pieces of evidence and their impact on the probability. Let H be the hypothesis that imports resume before 2026.

*   **Evidence 1: NWS cases confirmed in Nuevo León, near the U.S. border (September/October 2025).**
    *   This evidence is much more likely if the ban is *not* lifted by 2026 (P(E|~H) is high), as it demonstrates a proximate and uncontrolled threat that justifies continued closure. It is less likely if the situation were secure enough to reopen so soon (P(E|H) is low).
    *   **Likelihood Ratio (P(E|H)/P(E|~H)) << 1.** This is strong evidence *against* a near-term reopening. It effectively "resets the clock" on the timeline for demonstrating control.

*   **Evidence 2: New U.S.-supported sterile fly dispersal facility opened in Tampico, Mexico (mid-November 2025).**
    *   This is the primary operational tool to solve the problem in the critical border region. This action is a necessary precondition for any reopening. It is highly likely given a near-term reopening (P(E|H) is high). It is also likely under a longer-term reopening scenario, but its timing in mid-November points to a concerted push for a faster solution.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio > 1.** This is strong evidence *for* a reopening, as it shows the most critical countermeasure is now being deployed at scale.

*   **Evidence 3: The remaining timeline is very short (~40 days) and includes the U.S. holiday season.**
    *   APHIS requires a sustained period of surveillance with no new cases to be confident the risk is mitigated. One NWS life cycle is about three weeks. The agency would likely want to see at least two consecutive life cycles (~6 weeks) of negative results before acting. This period exceeds the available time. Furthermore, government bureaucratic processes slow significantly from Thanksgiving to New Year's.
    *   This timeline is highly unlikely to be sufficient for a reopening (P(E|H) is very low). It is very likely to be insufficient, making "no reopening" the default outcome (P(E|~H) is very high).
    *   **Likelihood Ratio << 1.** This is the most powerful piece of evidence against the hypothesis.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
*   **Prior Odds:** 0.54 (35% probability).
*   **Step 1 (Negative Evidence):** The cases in Nuevo León significantly lower the odds. They create a high bar for APHIS to clear. The odds decrease substantially.
*   **Step 2 (Positive Evidence):** The opening of the Tampico facility is a powerful countermeasure. It provides the means to clear that high bar and raises the odds back up, though likely not to the original level because the *proof* of its effectiveness is not yet available.
*   **Step 3 (Overwhelming Negative Evidence):** The timeline constraint is the decisive factor. The ~40-day window is almost certainly too short for the Tampico facility's effects to be observed, verified over multiple insect life cycles, and then pushed through a risk-averse bureaucracy during a holiday period. This dramatically reduces the odds.

The net effect is a strong downward revision from the 35% prior. The positive operational news is fighting a losing battle against the bureaucratic and biological clocks. The resulting posterior probability is low.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My analysis hinges on the belief that APHIS will follow its standard, cautious, data-driven process. What if this is wrong?

*   **Alternative Scenario:** Intense economic and political pressure from the U.S. cattle industry and the Mexican government could force a faster, more political decision. The opening of the Tampico facility could be used as the political justification to announce a *partial reopening* (e.g., only for cattle from certified NWS-free zones) before the end of the year, even if the data is still preliminary. The question's wording ("permitted to resume") would be satisfied by such a limited reopening.
*   **Rebuttal:** While possible, this carries significant risk. A premature reopening that leads to an NWS infestation in the U.S. would be a catastrophic failure for the USDA. Therefore, even a politically motivated decision would likely require some credible evidence of success, which is difficult to generate in just 40 days.
*   **Adjustment:** The possibility of a partial, politically expedited reopening is the strongest argument against a single-digit probability. It introduces a non-trivial chance of a "Yes" resolution. I will adjust my final forecast slightly upward from a very low number to account for this plausible, albeit unlikely, scenario.

### 6. Final Forecast
The operational response to the NWS outbreak is strong and well-funded. However, the timeline for this question is extremely constrained. The biological reality of the screwworm life cycle and the institutional reality of regulatory risk aversion at USDA/APHIS create formidable barriers to lifting the import ban in the next 40 days, especially over a holiday period. The recent discovery of cases near the border has reset the clock, requiring a new, sustained period of negative surveillance that almost certainly cannot be completed before 2026. While a politically motivated partial reopening is a possibility, it remains a tail risk.

Final: 12%
