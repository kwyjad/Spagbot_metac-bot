### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Supreme Court Review of Unanimous Lower Court Rulings on Executive Power:** The Supreme Court often takes cases where it intends to reverse, but when multiple lower courts have reached the same conclusion (even with different reasoning), it suggests the legal arguments against the government's position are strong. In such cases, affirmance is more common than reversal. A ballpark base rate for the Supreme Court affirming a consistent direction of lower court rulings on a major statutory question could be **60-70%**. In this case, affirming would mean ruling the tariffs are unlawful.
2.  **Major Questions Doctrine Cases:** This case fits squarely into the modern "Major Questions Doctrine," where the Court is skeptical of executive agencies claiming vast new powers of major economic and political significance without clear congressional authorization. In recent years (e.g., *West Virginia v. EPA*, the OSHA vaccine mandate case), the executive branch has consistently lost these challenges. The base rate for the government losing a case where the Major Questions Doctrine is a central issue is very high, perhaps **80-90%**.
3.  **Presidential Power in Foreign Affairs/National Security:** Historically, the Court grants significant deference to the President in this domain (*United States v. Curtiss-Wright*). However, IEEPA is a statutory delegation, not an inherent power, and its use for broad economic policy blurs the line between foreign and domestic affairs. The base rate for the President winning on claims of statutory authority in foreign affairs is historically high (**>70%**), but this has been eroding, and this case's facts push it away from the core of that reference class.

Limitations: These are rough estimates. Each case is unique, and the current Court's composition and jurisprudential shifts (especially regarding the Major Questions Doctrine) make historical base rates less reliable. The second reference class is likely the most relevant.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-11-14** Trump admin removes reciprocal tariffs on 200+ agricultural products. — **↓** (for Tariffs lawful) — This action, taken just after oral arguments, suggests the administration may perceive legal weakness and is attempting to moot part of the case or mitigate political/economic damage.
*   **2025-11-05** Supreme Court hears oral arguments. — **~** (neutral) — This event starts the clock for a final decision. The content of the arguments is a key driver, but the event itself is a procedural step. The expedited schedule increases the chance of a 2025 ruling.
*   **2025-09-09** Supreme Court agrees to consolidate and expedite review. — **↓** (for No 2025 ruling) — The Court's decision to fast-track the case signals its view of the issue's urgency and makes a ruling before the end of the year significantly more likely.
*   **2025-08-29** Federal Circuit affirms the lower court ruling against the tariffs in a 7-4 decision. — **↓** (for Tariffs lawful) — A powerful appellate court affirmed the illegality of the tariffs, providing a well-reasoned majority opinion for the Supreme Court to potentially adopt and strengthening the case against the administration.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Major Questions Doctrine:** The Court's 6-3 conservative majority has aggressively used this doctrine to strike down executive actions that lack "clear congressional authorization" for issues of vast economic and political significance. Imposing tariffs on nearly all global trade fits this description perfectly. (Large driver toward **Tariffs unlawful**).
2.  **Textualism:** The text of the IEEPA does not explicitly mention "tariffs" or "duties." It allows the President to "regulate" imports. Challengers argue this is too vague to authorize a power as significant as tariffs, which the Constitution explicitly grants to Congress. The Court's textualist leanings favor this narrow reading. (Large driver toward **Tariffs unlawful**).
3.  **Distinction Between Tariff Types:** The Court may distinguish between the "trafficking tariffs" and the "reciprocal tariffs." The former have a clearer nexus to a traditional national security threat (cartels), while the latter (based on trade deficits) look like pure economic policymaking. This provides a path for a compromise. (Large driver toward **Mixed ruling**).
4.  **Foreign Affairs Deference:** The government's strongest argument is that the President deserves broad deference in matters of foreign policy and national security. The Court has historically supported this, but may see this case as an overreach into domestic economic regulation under a foreign policy guise. (Moderate driver toward **Tariffs lawful**).
5.  **Unanimity of Lower Court Outcomes:** Two different federal courts, including a specialized trade court and a key appellate court, have ruled against the administration. This creates a strong current of judicial agreement that the President overstepped his authority, which the Supreme Court may be hesitant to buck. (Moderate driver toward **Tariffs unlawful**).
6.  **Speed of Decision:** The expedited schedule means a decision is likely by December 31, 2025. This reduces the probability of "No 2025 ruling." (Large driver *away from* **No 2025 ruling**).

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Unprecedented Scope of IEEPA Use:** Unlike past uses of IEEPA for targeted sanctions (e.g., against Iran), this is the first time a President has used it to fundamentally restructure U.S. trade policy on a global scale.
*   **Economic "Emergency":** The declaration of a "national emergency" based on trade deficits is a novel and legally tenuous justification, stretching the concept far beyond its traditional national security context.
*   **Ascendant Major Questions Doctrine:** The Court's current, robust application of this doctrine is a relatively recent development (last 5-10 years) and is far more potent than it was when older precedents on executive power were decided.
*   **Consolidation of Different Legal Theories:** The Court is reviewing two cases with different rationales for the same outcome (unlawful). This gives the justices multiple independent paths (IEEPA doesn't authorize tariffs at all vs. these specific tariffs don't "deal with" the threat) to strike down the policy.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Based on the reference class of SCOTUS affirming unanimous lower court trends and the high failure rate for the executive under the Major Questions Doctrine, a reasonable prior would be centered on "Tariffs unlawful." (e.g., P(Unlawful)=55%, P(Mixed)=25%, P(Lawful)=10%, P(Other/None)=10%; equivalent n=15).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   **↑ Unlawful:** The Court's clear jurisprudential direction on the Major Questions Doctrine and textualism is a very strong signal. (Large magnitude).
    *   **↑ Mixed:** The plausible distinction between the trafficking and reciprocal tariffs provides a clear off-ramp for a split decision, which could appeal to justices seeking a compromise. (Large magnitude).
    *   **↓ Lawful:** The recent partial rollback of agricultural tariffs suggests the administration's confidence is low. (Moderate magnitude).
    *   **↓ Lawful:** The Federal Circuit's strong affirmation adds weight to the challengers' case. (Moderate magnitude).
    *   **↓ No 2025 ruling:** The expedited schedule makes a decision this year highly probable. (Large magnitude).
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly reinforces the prior against "Tariffs lawful." The posterior probability should shift heavily towards a combination of **"Tariffs unlawful"** and **"Mixed ruling,"** with "Unlawful" being the more probable of the two. The probability of "No 2025 ruling" should decrease substantially.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators (favoring Lawful/Mixed):**
    *   Leaks from oral argument transcripts suggesting several justices were highly deferential to the government's national security claims.
    *   Op-eds from prominent conservative legal scholars (e.g., associated with the Federalist Society) defending the President's broad IEEPA authority.
    *   The administration announcing a new, more direct link between reciprocal tariffs and a specific national security threat.
*   **DOWN indicators (favoring Unlawful):**
    *   Further rollbacks of tariffs by the Trump administration, suggesting an attempt to make the case moot.
    *   Leaks from the Court suggesting a strong majority coalescing around a Major Questions Doctrine rationale.
    *   Statements from key Republican members of Congress criticizing the tariffs or introducing legislation to curb IEEPA power.
    *   A decision being released very early in December, which can sometimes signal a less-divided court.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Resolution Deadline:** The Dec 31, 2025 deadline is tight. While the expedited schedule makes a 2025 ruling likely, any unexpected delay could push the decision into January 2026, triggering the "No 2025 ruling" outcome.
*   **Definition of "Mixed Ruling":** This outcome is triggered if *any* part of the tariffs is upheld and *any* part is struck down. The Court could uphold the tariffs on a single country or product category while striking down the rest, which would resolve as "

To forecast how the Supreme Court will rule on Trump's tariffs in 2025, we will follow the outlined steps:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**:
   - **Tariffs unlawful**: Given the Supreme Court's recent trend of skepticism towards executive overreach under the Major Questions Doctrine, the base rate for the government losing such cases is high, around 80-90%. This aligns with the lower courts' rulings against the tariffs.
   - **Tariffs lawful**: Historically, the Court has granted deference to the President in foreign affairs, but this has been eroding. A base rate of around 10-20% seems reasonable.
   - **Mixed ruling**: The possibility of a split decision, where some tariffs are upheld and others struck down, is plausible given the distinct nature of the tariffs involved. A base rate of 20-30% is appropriate.
   - **Other ruling**: This is less common, but possible if the Court finds procedural issues. A base rate of 5-10% is reasonable.
   - **No 2025 ruling**: Given the expedited schedule, the likelihood of no ruling by the end of 2025 is low, around 5-10%.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**:
   - The current case aligns with the base rate scenario of the Major Questions Doctrine, where executive overreach is often struck down.
   - Differences include the unprecedented scope of IEEPA use and the economic nature of the "emergency," which could influence the Court's decision.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**:
   - **Tariffs unlawful**: The unanimous lower court rulings and the Major Questions Doctrine strongly support this outcome. Likelihood is high.
   - **Tariffs lawful**: The removal of some tariffs suggests the administration's legal position is weak. Likelihood is low.
   - **Mixed ruling**: The distinct nature of the tariffs provides a plausible path for a split decision. Likelihood is moderate.
   - **Other ruling**: The Court's decision to expedite suggests it intends to rule on the merits, making this less likely.
   - **No 2025 ruling**: The expedited schedule makes this unlikely.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior)**:
   - Starting with a prior centered on "Tariffs unlawful," the evidence strongly reinforces this outcome. The likelihood of a "Mixed ruling" is also supported by the distinct nature of the tariffs.
   - **Posterior probabilities**:
     - Tariffs unlawful: Increase from prior due to strong evidence.
     - Mixed ruling: Moderate increase due to plausible split decision.
     - Tariffs lawful: Decrease due to weak legal position.
     - Other ruling: Slight decrease due to expedited schedule.
     - No 2025 ruling: Decrease due to expedited schedule.

5. **Red Team Thinking**:
   - Consider the possibility of overconfidence in the "Tariffs unlawful" outcome. The Court's deference to presidential power in foreign affairs, although eroding, could still play a role.
   - The "Mixed ruling" scenario is plausible and should be given due weight.

6. **Final Normalization**:
   - Ensure probabilities sum to approximately 100%.

7. **Output Format**:
   - Tariffs unlawful: 50%
   - Mixed ruling: 30%
   - Tariffs lawful: 10%
   - Other ruling: 5%
   - No 2025 ruling: 5%

# Analysis of Supreme Court Ruling on Trump's Tariffs in 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I'll consider several relevant reference classes:

**Major Questions Doctrine Cases (2018-2025):**
- The Court has consistently ruled against executive branch claims of broad authority without clear congressional authorization
- Base rate for executive branch losing: ~80%
- This suggests a prior of ~80% for "Tariffs unlawful"

**IEEPA Cases Specifically:**
- Limited Supreme Court precedent on IEEPA's scope
- Lower courts have generally allowed targeted sanctions but scrutinized broader economic measures
- Base rate for executive branch winning on narrow IEEPA claims: ~60%
- Base rate for executive branch winning on expansive IEEPA claims: ~30%
- Given the unprecedented breadth of these tariffs, this suggests a prior of ~70% for "Tariffs unlawful"

**Supreme Court Timing with Expedited Schedule:**
- When the Court grants expedited review and hears arguments in November
- Base rate for decision by December 31: ~90%
- This suggests a prior of ~10% for "No 2025 ruling"

**Mixed Rulings in Complex Administrative Law Cases:**
- When multiple legal theories and different types of executive actions are under review
- Base rate for split decisions: ~25%
- This suggests a prior of ~25% for "Mixed ruling"

Combining these reference classes, my initial priors are:
- Tariffs lawful: 15%
- Tariffs unlawful: 50% 
- Mixed ruling: 25%
- Other ruling: 5%
- No 2025 ruling: 5%

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Like other Major Questions Doctrine cases, this involves an executive branch claim of vast economic power without explicit congressional authorization
- Like other expedited cases, this has a compressed briefing and argument schedule
- Like other IEEPA cases, this involves presidential action citing national security

**Key differences:**
- Unprecedented scope: Using IEEPA for global tariff policy rather than targeted sanctions
- Novel emergency justification: Trade deficits as a "national emergency" stretches the concept
- Unanimous lower courts: Both the Court of International Trade and D.C. District Court ruled against the tariffs, albeit on different grounds
- Federal Circuit affirmation: A 7-4 decision with bipartisan composition in both majority and dissent
- Two distinct tariff types: The trafficking tariffs (Mexico/Canada/China) have a clearer security nexus than the reciprocal tariffs (global)

These differences suggest the Court is more likely to rule against at least some tariffs than the base rate would indicate, and the distinction between tariff types increases the probability of a mixed ruling.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence: Expedited review granted**
- P(Expedited | No 2025 ruling) = Very low (~5%)
- P(Expedited | Will rule in 2025) = High (~80%)
- This strongly decreases probability of "No 2025 ruling"

**Evidence: Federal Circuit 7-4 decision against tariffs**
- P(7-4 Circuit ruling | Tariffs lawful) = Low (~20%)
- P(7-4 Circuit ruling | Tariffs unlawful) = High (~70%)
- This increases probability of "Tariffs unlawful"

**Evidence: Two different legal theories in lower courts**
- P(Different theories | Mixed ruling) = Moderate (~50%)
- P(Different theories | Uniform ruling) = Lower (~30%)
- This increases probability of "Mixed ruling"

**Evidence: Trump administration removing agricultural tariffs after oral arguments**
- P(Removing tariffs | Tariffs lawful) = Very low (~5%)
- P(Removing tariffs | Tariffs unlawful/Mixed) = Moderate (~40%)
- This decreases probability of "Tariffs lawful"

**Evidence: Distinction between trafficking and reciprocal tariffs**
- P(Distinct tariff types | Mixed ruling) = High (~70%)
- P(Distinct tariff types | Uniform ruling) = Lower (~30%)
- This increases probability of "Mixed ruling"

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

Starting with my prior probabilities:
- Tariffs lawful: 15%
- Tariffs unlawful: 50%
- Mixed ruling: 25%
- Other ruling: 5%
- No 2025 ruling: 5%

**Update on expedited review:**
- Prior odds (No 2025 ruling) = 5/95 = 0.053
- Likelihood ratio = 5/80 = 0.0625
- Posterior odds = 0.053 × 0.0625 = 0.0033
- Posterior probability (No 2025 ruling) ≈ 0.3%
- Redistributing probability mass proportionally to other outcomes

**Update on Federal Circuit ruling:**
- Prior odds (Tariffs lawful) = 15/85 = 0.176
- Likelihood ratio = 20/70 = 0.286
- Posterior odds = 0.176 × 0.286 = 0.050
- Posterior probability (Tariffs lawful) ≈ 5%
- Redistributing probability mass to "Unlawful" and "Mixed"

**Update on tariff removal after oral arguments:**
- Prior odds (Tariffs lawful) = 5/95 = 0.053
- Likelihood ratio = 5/40 = 0.125
- Posterior odds = 0.053 × 0.125 = 0.0066
- Posterior probability (Tariffs lawful) ≈ 0.7%
- Redistributing probability mass to "Unlawful" and "Mixed"

**Update on distinction between tariff types:**
- Prior odds (Mixed ruling) = 30/70 = 0.429
- Likelihood ratio = 70/30 = 2.33
- Posterior odds = 0.429 × 2.33 = 1.0
- Posterior probability (Mixed ruling) ≈ 50%
- Taking probability mass primarily from "Tariffs unlawful"

After these updates, my posterior probabilities are approximately:
- Tariffs lawful: 1%
- Tariffs unlawful: 44%
- Mixed ruling: 50%
- Other ruling: 4%
- No 2025 ruling: 1%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the Court's deference to presidential power in foreign affairs
- The Court's 6-3 conservative majority might be more sympathetic to a Republican president's economic policies
- The Court could find a narrower procedural ground to avoid the merits entirely
- I might be overestimating the likelihood of a mixed ruling based on the distinction between tariff types

**Alternative scenarios:**
- The Court could uphold the trafficking tariffs while striking down the reciprocal tariffs, which would still count as a "Mixed ruling"
- The Court could dismiss the case as improvidently granted if the administration continues to roll back tariffs
- The Court could issue a narrow ruling focused on statutory interpretation rather than constitutional principles

**Adjustments:**
- I should increase "Other ruling" slightly to account for procedural off-ramps
- I should slightly decrease "Mixed ruling" as it requires a more complex opinion
- I should slightly increase "Tariffs unlawful" given the strong lower court consensus

## 6. Final Normalization

After red team adjustments:
- Tariffs lawful: 2% (slight increase to account for deference to executive)
- Tariffs unlawful: 48% (increase based on lower court consensus)
- Mixed ruling: 45% (decrease due to complexity of writing such an opinion)
- Other ruling: 4% (unchanged)
- No 2025 ruling: 1% (unchanged)

## 7. Final Forecast

Tariffs lawful: 2%
Tariffs unlawful: 48%
Mixed ruling: 45%
Other ruling: 4%
No 2025 ruling: 1%
(sum 100%)

```md

Here is my probabilistic forecast based on the provided information and a structured reasoning process.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

To establish a prior probability, I will consider three relevant reference classes:

1.  **Major Questions Doctrine (MQD) Cases:** The current Supreme Court has frequently invoked this doctrine to invalidate executive actions of "vast economic and political significance" not clearly authorized by Congress. In recent high-profile cases (*West Virginia v. EPA*, *NFIB v. OSHA*), the government's loss rate has been extremely high, approaching 80-90%. This is the most relevant reference class, suggesting a high prior probability for "Tariffs unlawful" or "Mixed ruling".
2.  **Supreme Court Review of Unanimous Lower Court Outcomes:** The background shows that two different federal courts ruled the tariffs unlawful, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed that conclusion. When lower courts are aligned on the outcome, the Supreme Court is more likely to affirm than in cases with a circuit split. A base rate for affirmance in such a scenario might be around 60%, which would map to "Tariffs unlawful".
3.  **Presidential Power in Foreign Affairs:** Historically, the Court grants significant deference to the President in foreign affairs and national security. This reference class would suggest a higher probability for "Tariffs lawful". However, the current case involves using a national security statute for what appears to be broad economic policy, weakening the fit with this class.

Synthesizing these, the MQD and lower court consensus are the most powerful indicators. I will set a prior that strongly favors a loss for the government: **P(Unlawful or Mixed) ≈ 80%**, with **P(Lawful) ≈ 15%** and **P(Other/No Ruling) ≈ 5%**.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities:** This case fits the MQD pattern perfectly. The administration is using a broad, decades-old statute (IEEPA) to justify a sweeping new policy (global tariffs) with immense economic impact, a power (setting tariffs) the Constitution primarily grants to Congress.
*   **Differences:** The key distinguishing factor is the foreign affairs and national security justification. Unlike purely domestic regulations (like in the EPA or OSHA cases), the President has a stronger claim to deference here. This is the government's most compelling argument. Additionally, the existence of two distinct tariff regimes—"trafficking tariffs" with a plausible security nexus and "reciprocal tariffs" with a weaker economic one—creates a clear pathway for a "Mixed ruling" that is not always present in other MQD cases.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will evaluate key pieces of evidence from the scenario:

*   **Evidence:** The Supreme Court granted an expedited review schedule, with arguments in November 2025.
    *   **Likelihood Assessment:** This action is highly probable if the Court intends to issue a ruling in 2025, and highly improbable if it does not. P(Expedited Review | 2025 Ruling) is high; P(Expedited Review | No 2025 Ruling) is very low.
    *   **Impact:** This evidence strongly shifts probability *away* from the "No 2025 ruling" option.

*   **Evidence:** The Trump administration removed reciprocal tariffs on some agricultural products after oral arguments.
    *   **Likelihood Assessment:** A party is much more likely to voluntarily scale back a challenged policy if they believe they are likely to lose in court. This action signals a lack of confidence. P(Rollback | Expecting to Lose) is much higher than P(Rollback | Expecting to Win).
    *   **Impact:** This evidence strongly shifts probability *away* from "Tariffs lawful" and towards "Tariffs unlawful" and "Mixed ruling".

*   **Evidence:** The case involves two distinct tariff types (trafficking vs. reciprocal).
    *   **Likelihood Assessment:** This factual predicate makes a "Mixed ruling" a very viable option for the Court. It allows justices to draw a line, striking down the more aggressive use of IEEPA (reciprocal tariffs) while potentially upholding the part with a clearer national security link (trafficking tariffs).
    *   **Impact:** This increases the relative probability of "Mixed ruling" as a plausible compromise outcome.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

Let's walk through a conceptual update.

1.  **Prior:** Start with a high probability (≈80%) that the government loses in whole or in part.
2.  **Update 1 (Expedited Schedule):** The evidence of an expedited schedule drastically reduces the probability of "No 2025 ruling" from a generic small chance to a very small one (e.g., from 5% down to 3%).
3.  **Update 2 (Lower Court Consensus & Admin Rollback):** The unanimous lower court outcomes and the administration's partial rollback are strong evidence against the legality of the tariffs. This moves probability away from "Tariffs lawful," reducing it from our prior of ≈15% to a posterior of ≈5%.
4.  **Update 3 (Distinction between Tariffs):** The two types of tariffs provide a clear off-ramp for a compromise. This makes "Mixed ruling" a more attractive outcome for justices seeking a narrow decision. This shifts some probability from the "Tariffs unlawful" outcome (a complete government loss) to the "Mixed ruling" outcome (a partial loss). The final distribution of probability between these two options becomes the central question. A complete rebuke based on the MQD ("Tariffs unlawful") seems slightly more probable given the Court's recent trend, but a compromise ("Mixed ruling") is a very close second.

This process leads to a posterior where "Tariffs unlawful" is the most likely outcome, "Mixed ruling" is a strong second, and all other options are unlikely.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

I must consider potential blind spots. My forecast is heavily reliant on the power of the Major Questions Doctrine. The primary risk is that I am underestimating the Court's willingness to defer to the President in matters of foreign commerce and national security, which could lead to a "Tariffs lawful" or "Mixed ruling" outcome. The "Mixed ruling" option is a significant possibility, as it allows the Court to curb the most extreme executive overreach (reciprocal tariffs) while preserving presidential power for more traditional security threats (trafficking). I have assigned a substantial probability (35%) to this outcome to reflect this. I have also assigned a small but non-zero probability (3%) to "No 2025 ruling" to account for potential delays in issuing an opinion on a complex, expedited case.

### 6. Final Normalization

The probabilities are adjusted to reflect the analysis and sum to 100%. The final forecast assigns a 90% probability that the government will lose on at least some of the tariffs.

Tariffs lawful: 5%
Tariffs unlawful: 55%
Mixed ruling: 35%
Other ruling: 2%
No 2025 ruling: 3%
