### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Large-scale, non-conflict, non-imminent disaster urban evacuations:** This is the most relevant class. Governments rarely order mass evacuations of major cities for chronic, slow-moving crises like resource scarcity. Most large evacuations are for acute, immediate threats like hurricanes (e.g., New Orleans), industrial accidents (e.g., Chernobyl), or military conflict. The base rate for a major capital city ordering a 100k+ person evacuation due to a chronic environmental issue within a given year is extremely low, likely **<0.5%**. This is derived from the near-total absence of such events in modern history.
2.  **Implementation of long-debated capital relocation plans:** Many countries have debated moving their capitals for decades (e.g., South Korea, Argentina), but few have acted. Those that have (e.g., Brazil, Kazakhstan, Myanmar, Indonesia) undertake multi-decade, multi-billion dollar projects. An "evacuation" is not a "relocation." The base rate for a country *starting* a physical relocation in a given year after decades of talk is low, perhaps **1-2%**. This class is less relevant to the specific question of a short-fuse *evacuation* but highlights the immense inertia against such moves.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-11-20** President Pezeshkian states capital relocation is "mandatory" due to water shortages. — ↑ — Elevates the issue from a strategic choice to an urgent necessity, increasing the political justification for drastic action.
*   **2025-11-14** Pezeshkian links potential evacuation directly to a lack of rain by November 21. — ↑↑ — Creates a specific, near-term trigger and timeline for the first time, moving the discussion from abstract to conditional and imminent.
*   **2025-01-07** Government announces intent to relocate the capital to the Makran coast. — ↑ — Formalizes the long-term plan, providing a destination and official backing, which could be used to justify initial evacuation steps.
*   **2024-12-03** Pezeshkian's economic interview highlights pragmatic policymaking and addressing subsidies. — ↓ — Signals a focus on complex, systemic economic reforms, which an expensive, chaotic evacuation would derail. Suggests a preference for methodical solutions.
*   **2024-11-12** Pezeshkian signals openness to managed engagement with the U.S. — ↓ — A diplomatic opening would likely prioritize economic stability and sanctions relief, making a disruptive domestic crisis like a mass evacuation politically undesirable.
*   **2024-07-30** Pezeshkian, a reformist-backed centrist, is sworn in as president. — ↑/↓ — His pragmatic, technocratic background (↑) might make him more likely to act on scientific warnings, but his reformist leanings (↓) may also make him more sensitive to the massive social disruption and potential for unrest.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Water Crisis Severity:** The primary driver. If rainfall fails and reservoirs approach "dead pool" levels, the government's hand may be forced. This is a **large** driver, as it creates a non-political, physical reality that demands a response.
2.  **Presidential Political Will & Rhetoric:** Pezeshkian has personally and repeatedly staked his credibility on this issue. His statements create political momentum that is difficult to reverse without losing face or appearing incompetent. This is a **moderate-to-large** driver.
3.  **Logistical & Financial Capacity:** This is the main counterweight. Evacuating and providing for 100,000 people requires immense logistical coordination (transport, housing, food, security) and funding, which are severely constrained in Iran's sanctioned economy. This is a **large** negative driver.
4.  **Risk of Social & Political Instability:** A forced evacuation could be perceived as a catastrophic failure of governance, potentially triggering widespread panic, protests, and a legitimacy crisis. The regime is highly sensitive to this risk. This is a **large** negative driver.
5.  **Availability of Short-Term Alternatives:** The government could pursue extreme water rationing, desalination projects, or cloud seeding before resorting to evacuation. The existence of these (even if painful) off-ramps reduces the probability of the most extreme option. This is a **moderate** negative driver.
6.  **Bureaucratic & Factional Inertia:** Such a monumental decision would face intense opposition from within the Iranian state apparatus, from ministries whose budgets would be cut to hardliners who may view it as a sign of weakness or a distraction. This is a **moderate** negative driver.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Shift from Strategic to Emergency Framing:** Unlike typical capital relocation debates (e.g., Indonesia's plan for Nusantara), the Iranian discussion has been reframed from a long-term strategic project into an urgent, short-horizon emergency response to a specific crisis (drought).
*   **Specific, Imminent Trigger:** The President has publicly named a specific condition (no rain by Nov 21) for considering evacuation. This is highly unusual; such decisions are typically made behind closed doors, not tied to a public, near-term deadline.
*   **Leader Profile:** President Pezeshkian is a physician and technocrat, not a typical ideologue. This may make him more inclined to accept and act upon dire scientific assessments, whereas other leaders might dismiss them for political reasons.
*   **Convergence of Crises:** Tehran's problems are not just water. The combination of extreme subsidence, seismic risk, and pollution creates a powerful narrative that a single crisis (water) could be the final straw justifying a long-overdue, drastic action.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a very low prior (e.g., 1-2%) based on the extreme rarity of such events (equivalent n=100, k=1 or 2). The base rate strongly suggests this is a tail risk.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   ↑ (Large): Presidential rhetoric explicitly and repeatedly linking a near-term deadline (Nov 21) to a potential evacuation order. This is the strongest piece of new evidence.
    *   ↑ (Moderate): The underlying environmental data (subsidence, water stress) has worsened, providing a strong factual basis for the government's alarmist stance.
    *   ↓ (Large): The immense, perhaps insurmountable, logistical, financial, and political barriers to executing such an order in ~40 days without causing chaos.
    *   ↓ (Moderate): The availability of less drastic, albeit painful, alternatives like severe water rationing, which would almost certainly be attempted first.
*   **Net effect:** The recent, specific, and high-level rhetoric dramatically increases the probability from the very low prior. However, the powerful real-world constraints mean the probability should remain low, but not negligible. The posterior should move up significantly from the prior, perhaps into the 5-15% range, reflecting a newly credible, though still unlikely, threat.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Official implementation of severe, city-wide water rationing in Tehran.
    *   Public announcements tasking the IRGC or military with planning for population movement.
    *   State media begins a campaign to prepare the public for "difficult but necessary" measures.
    *   Identification and preparation of specific relocation sites or host cities.
    *   Unusual movements of transport assets (buses, trains) towards Tehran.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Significant and sustained rainfall over Tehran's watershed.
    *   Presidential statements walking back the evacuation threat, reframing it as a "worst-case scenario."
    *   Announcement of a major new infrastructure project as an alternative (e.g., emergency pipeline, desalination plant).
    *   Prominent political figures or factions publicly criticizing the evacuation plan.
    *   Focus of government communication shifts back to long-term capital relocation rather than short-term evacuation.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Rhetoric vs. Intent:** The President's statements could be a political tool to shock the public and bureaucracy into accepting severe water conservation measures or to build support for the long-term capital move, without any real intention of ordering an evacuation.
*   **Definitional Ambiguity:** The resolution requires an "order" for an "evacuation." This could be difficult to verify. The government might use ambiguous language, "strongly recommend" relocation, or offer incentives that fall short of a formal order.
*   **Information Control:** The Iranian government controls the media narrative. Any official plan would be heavily managed, and verifying the true scale and nature of an evacuation order could be difficult. Independent confirmation would be crucial.
*   **Partial or Symbolic Action:** The government could order the evacuation of a single, highly symbolic but small government ministry or a specific, small neighborhood to claim action, while falling short of the 100,000-person threshold.
*   **Short Horizon:** With only ~40 days to resolution, events will move very quickly. The weather in the next 1-2 weeks is a critical, unpredictable variable.

**Final Research Summary:** The Iranian President's recent, urgent rhetoric has made a previously unthinkable short-term evacuation of Tehran a plausible scenario. While the probability is significantly elevated from its near-zero baseline, it remains a low-probability event due to overwhelming logistical, financial, and political obstacles that make less drastic measures far more likely in the immediate term.

To forecast the probability of Iran announcing an evacuation of Tehran before 2026, we will follow the structured Bayesian reasoning process.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The base rate for large-scale, non-conflict, non-imminent disaster urban evacuations is extremely low, likely less than 0.5%. This is due to the rarity of such events in modern history, especially for chronic issues like resource scarcity. Therefore, we start with a prior probability of 0.5%.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
**Similarities:**
- The situation involves a chronic environmental issue (water scarcity) similar to the base case of slow-moving crises.
- The historical inertia against large-scale evacuations for non-acute threats is present.

**Differences:**
- The Iranian government has shifted the framing from a strategic to an emergency response, which is unusual.
- A specific, near-term trigger (lack of rain by November 21) has been publicly stated, which is not typical in such scenarios.

These differences suggest a higher probability than the base rate, as the situation has been framed as an urgent crisis with a specific trigger.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Presidential Rhetoric:** The President's explicit linkage of evacuation to a specific date increases the likelihood of the event occurring. This evidence strongly increases the probability.
- **Environmental Data:** Worsening subsidence and water stress provide a factual basis for the urgency, moderately increasing the probability.
- **Logistical and Financial Constraints:** The immense challenges in executing an evacuation decrease the probability significantly.
- **Availability of Alternatives:** The potential for severe water rationing and other measures decreases the probability moderately.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Starting with a prior of 0.5%, we adjust based on the evidence:
- **Presidential Rhetoric and Environmental Data:** Increase the probability significantly, suggesting a move from 0.5% to around 5%.
- **Logistical Constraints and Alternatives:** Counterbalance the increase, suggesting a final adjustment to around 10%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Risk:** The probability might be overestimated due to the dramatic rhetoric. The logistical and political barriers are substantial.
- **Alternative Scenarios:** The government might use the threat of evacuation to enforce severe water rationing without actual evacuation.
- **Rebuttals:** The President's statements could be a political maneuver rather than a genuine intent to evacuate.

### 6. Final Forecast
Considering the base rate, evidence, and potential biases, the final probability reflects a significant increase from the base rate but remains low due to substantial barriers.

Final: 10%

# Will Iran announce an evacuation of Tehran before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to identify an appropriate base rate for a government ordering a large-scale evacuation of its capital city due to environmental factors.

The most relevant reference class is **large-scale, non-conflict, non-imminent disaster urban evacuations**. Governments rarely order mass evacuations of major cities for chronic, slow-moving crises like resource scarcity. Most large evacuations are for acute threats like hurricanes, industrial accidents, or military conflict.

Looking at historical precedents:
- No major capital city has been evacuated due to water scarcity
- Planned capital relocations (Brazil, Kazakhstan, Myanmar, Indonesia) were multi-decade projects, not evacuations
- Environmental evacuations typically occur for immediate threats (e.g., Chernobyl), not slow-developing crises

The base rate for a major capital city ordering a 100k+ person evacuation due to a chronic environmental issue within a given year is extremely low, likely **1-2%**. This reflects the near-total absence of such events in modern history.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Tehran faces genuine environmental challenges (water scarcity, subsidence, pollution)
- The logistical challenges of evacuating millions of people remain enormous
- Political and economic costs of evacuation are prohibitively high
- Alternatives to evacuation exist (rationing, infrastructure projects)

**Key differences:**
- The President has explicitly linked evacuation to a specific trigger date (Nov 21, 2025)
- The rhetoric has shifted from long-term relocation to potential near-term evacuation
- The water crisis appears to be reaching a critical threshold
- President Pezeshkian is a technocrat who may be more responsive to scientific warnings
- The government has already formally announced intent to relocate the capital

These differences, particularly the explicit evacuation threat tied to a specific date, significantly increase the probability above the base rate.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: President's explicit evacuation threat linked to Nov 21 deadline**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.9) - If evacuation is planned, such a statement would be expected
- P(E|~H): Low (~0.2) - Such specific threats are rare without serious intent
- Likelihood ratio: ~4.5
- This strongly increases probability

**Evidence 2: Official announcement of intent to relocate capital to Makran**
- P(E|H): High (~0.8) - A formal relocation plan is a logical precursor to evacuation
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.4) - Many countries announce relocations without evacuations
- Likelihood ratio: ~2
- This moderately increases probability

**Evidence 3: Worsening environmental data (subsidence, water stress)**
- P(E|H): High (~0.8) - Evacuation would require genuine environmental crisis
- P(E|~H): Moderate-high (~0.6) - Environmental problems can exist without triggering evacuation
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.33
- This slightly increases probability

**Evidence 4: Logistical and financial constraints in Iran's sanctioned economy**
- P(E|H): Low (~0.3) - Evacuation would proceed despite these constraints
- P(E|~H): Very high (~0.9) - These constraints typically prevent such massive undertakings
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.33
- This significantly decreases probability

**Evidence 5: Availability of less drastic alternatives (rationing, infrastructure)**
- P(E|H): Moderate (~0.5) - Evacuation might occur after these fail
- P(E|~H): Very high (~0.9) - Governments typically exhaust all alternatives first
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.56
- This moderately decreases probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 1-2% (0.01-0.02):
- Prior odds: 0.02 / 0.98 = 0.0204

Applying the first key piece of evidence (President's explicit threat):
- Posterior odds = 0.0204 × 4.5 = 0.0918
- Posterior probability = 0.0918 / (1 + 0.0918) = 0.0841 or ~8.4%

Applying the second key piece of evidence (official relocation announcement):
- Posterior odds = 0.0918 × 2 = 0.1836
- Posterior probability = 0.1836 / (1 + 0.1836) = 0.1552 or ~15.5%

Applying the third key piece of evidence (environmental data):
- Posterior odds = 0.1836 × 1.33 = 0.2442
- Posterior probability = 0.2442 / (1 + 0.2442) = 0.1962 or ~19.6%

Applying the fourth key piece of evidence (logistical constraints):
- Posterior odds = 0.2442 × 0.33 = 0.0806
- Posterior probability = 0.0806 / (1 + 0.0806) = 0.0746 or ~7.5%

Applying the fifth key piece of evidence (alternatives):
- Posterior odds = 0.0806 × 0.56 = 0.0451
- Posterior probability = 0.0451 / (1 + 0.0451) = 0.0432 or ~4.3%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the severity of Tehran's water crisis
- The President's statements could reflect classified information about an imminent water system collapse
- I might be overestimating the Iranian government's rationality and underestimating its willingness to take drastic action
- The resolution criteria only requires an "order," not successful implementation

**Alternative scenarios:**
- The government could announce a "voluntary relocation program" that technically meets the criteria
- A partial evacuation of specific neighborhoods could be ordered
- The evacuation could be framed as temporary (e.g., "until the rainy season")

**Best alternative forecast:**
A much higher probability (~20-30%) could be justified if:
1. The water crisis is truly at a breaking point with no alternatives
2. The President's statements reflect a decision already made
3. The government views a controlled evacuation as preferable to uncontrolled panic

**Rebuttal:**
Even in this scenario, the enormous logistical challenges, political risks, and availability of less drastic measures make a full evacuation order unlikely. The government would almost certainly attempt severe rationing first.

After considering these factors, I'll adjust my forecast slightly upward to account for the possibility that the situation is more dire than publicly known.

## 6. Final Forecast

Considering all evidence and red-teaming, I assess the probability that Iran will announce an evacuation of Tehran before 2026 at 5%.

The key factors driving this assessment are:
1. The extremely low base rate for capital city evacuations due to chronic environmental issues
2. The President's explicit evacuation threat tied to a specific trigger date
3. The overwhelming logistical, financial, and political obstacles
4. The high likelihood that less drastic measures would be attempted first
5. The short timeframe remaining in 2025 (about 40 days)

Final: 5%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The event in question is a government-ordered, non-conflict-related evacuation of over 100,000 people from a major capital city due to a chronic environmental crisis. The appropriate reference class is "large-scale urban evacuations for slow-moving, non-military, non-acute disasters."

Historically, such events are exceptionally rare. Major evacuations are almost always prompted by acute, immediate threats like hurricanes, industrial accidents, or military invasions. Evacuations for chronic issues like water scarcity, subsidence, or pollution are virtually unprecedented in modern history. Cities facing these issues (e.g., Cape Town, Mexico City, Jakarta) have implemented rationing, pursued massive infrastructure projects, or planned gradual, multi-decade relocations, but have not ordered sudden mass evacuations.

Based on this near-total absence of historical precedent, the base rate for such an event occurring in any given year for a city in Tehran's position is extremely low. I will set the prior probability P(H) at **1%**. This reflects that it is a tail-risk event, but not an impossible one. In odds form, this is 1:99.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
**Similarities:** Like other cities in the reference class, Tehran faces immense logistical, economic, and political inertia against such a drastic move. The Iranian government, like any government, is also highly sensitive to the risk of social unrest and panic that a forced evacuation could trigger.

**Differences:**
1.  **Shift in Framing:** The discussion in Iran has dramatically shifted from a long-term, strategic capital relocation to a short-term, emergency response to an acute crisis (drought). This is a significant departure from the base case.
2.  **Specific, High-Level Threat:** President Pezeshkian has personally and publicly tied a potential evacuation to a specific, near-term condition ("no rain by Azar," Nov 21). This is highly unusual and elevates the threat from abstract to concrete and conditional. Heads of state do not typically make such specific, alarming, and falsifiable statements lightly.
3.  **Plausible "First Step" Scenario:** The resolution requires an evacuation of 100,000 people, not the entire city. This opens a plausible path that is not available in the base case: a "pilot evacuation" of government ministries and their staff as the first phase of the long-debated capital relocation plan, using the water crisis as the final justification. This is far more logistically and politically manageable than evacuating a random segment of the population.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
Let H be the event that Iran announces an evacuation of Tehran before 2026.

*   **Evidence (E1): President Pezeshkian's explicit and conditional threat of evacuation.**
    *   P(E1 | H): If the government were seriously planning to announce an evacuation, it is very likely the President would make such statements to prepare the public and justify the decision. This probability is high.
    *   P(E1 | ~H): If the government were *not* planning an evacuation, it is also plausible the President would make these statements as a political tool—a bluff to shock the public into accepting severe water rationing or to build support for the long-term relocation project.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio (P(E1|H)/P(E1|~H)):** The statement is more likely if an evacuation is actually being planned than if it's just a bluff. The LR is greater than 1, significantly increasing the probability from the base rate.

*   **Evidence (E2): The extreme logistical, financial, and political barriers to implementation within a ~40-day timeframe.**
    *   This is strong evidence against the event occurring. Any government, especially one under sanctions and wary of popular unrest, would see a rushed evacuation as a last resort fraught with peril. They would almost certainly exhaust less drastic options first, such as severe rationing, which would take time to implement and evaluate.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** This evidence strongly favors ~H. The probability of observing these immense barriers is high regardless, but their existence makes the decision to proceed (H) much less likely than the decision to stick to other measures (~H). The LR is significantly less than 1.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Starting with a prior of 1% (odds of 1:99), we update based on the evidence.

1.  **Initial Prior:** 1%
2.  **Update for Presidential Rhetoric:** The President's specific, high-stakes statements are a powerful piece of evidence. This is not typical political discourse. It makes the previously unthinkable scenario plausible, justifying a significant update. This evidence might increase the odds by a factor of 10, moving the probability from 1% to roughly 9-10%. This reflects the creation of a credible, albeit unlikely, pathway to the event.
3.  **Update for Constraints and Alternatives:** The immense real-world constraints (logistics, cost, political risk) and the availability of less extreme options (severe rationing) act as a powerful counterweight. The government is highly likely to try these alternatives before resorting to an evacuation order. This is especially true within the very short ~40-day timeframe. This evidence significantly reduces the probability. Let's say it cuts the updated odds in half, bringing the probability down to the 4-5% range.

However, the "pilot evacuation of government workers" scenario remains a plausible path. This reconciles the high-level threat with the logistical constraints. It would be a bold, symbolic move that serves multiple political and practical goals. This specific possibility keeps the probability from falling back to the baseline. Balancing these factors, the posterior probability should be significantly higher than the 1% prior, but still well below a 50/50 proposition.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast could be too low if the water crisis is even more acute than publicly reported, forcing the government's hand in a way that overrides normal political and logistical calculations. The "pilot evacuation" of 100,000 government workers could be a "shovel-ready" plan that they can announce quickly to show decisive action.

Conversely, my forecast could be too high if I am over-interpreting the President's rhetoric. It is very likely a political tactic to justify deeply unpopular water rationing, with no real intention of ordering an evacuation. Furthermore, the onset of Tehran's rainy season in the coming weeks provides a very probable and convenient "off-ramp" for the government to de-escalate the crisis rhetoric. The internal politics of Iran are opaque, and powerful factions like the IRGC could easily veto such a disruptive plan from a centrist president. The sheer bureaucratic inertia in executing such a plan within 40 days is a massive obstacle.

Considering these factors, the risk seems balanced. The rhetoric has opened the door to a real possibility, but the practical realities make it a very difficult path to follow in such a short time.

### 6. Final Forecast
The base rate for such an event is near zero. However, the Iranian President's specific and repeated public statements have created a credible, if unlikely, scenario. The primary driver is the severity of the water crisis meeting the long-term political goal of relocating the capital. The primary inhibitors are the extreme logistical/financial challenges and the immense risk of social unrest, all within a very tight 40-day timeframe. The most plausible path to a "Yes" is the announcement of a phased, "pilot" evacuation of government personnel. While this is more feasible than a general evacuation, it remains a drastic step that is more likely to be bluster than reality. Weighing the powerful rhetoric against the powerful constraints, I assess the probability to be low, but not negligible.

Final: 9%
