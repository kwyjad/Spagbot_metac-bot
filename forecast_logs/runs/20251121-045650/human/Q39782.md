### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Longest Field Goal (FG) per NFL Regular Season (2015-2024):** This class captures the modern era of kicking.
    *   **Data:** 61, 57, 61, 59, 63, 65, 66, 62, 61, 62 yards.
    *   **Base Rate:** The median is 61.5 yards, and the mean is 61.7 yards. However, there is a clear upward trend, with three of the four longest kicks (63, 65, 66) occurring since 2019. A simple trend extrapolation would suggest a baseline in the 63-65 yard range for 2025.
    *   **Limitations:** This 10-year period does not account for the potential regime change introduced by the 2025 "K-ball" rule or the accelerating talent curve. The sample size is small (n=10).

2.  **All-Time Longest Made FGs (Regular Season):** This class focuses on the demonstrated upper limits of performance.
    *   **Data (pre-2025):** 66 (2021), 64 (2013), 63 (x4, last in 2021). Four of the top six were made since 2021.
    *   **Base Rate:** The probability of a season's longest kick exceeding the all-time record is low, having happened only twice since 1970 (Prater in 2013, Tucker in 2021). This suggests that in any given year, the longest kick is more likely to be near, but not above, the existing record.
    *   **Limitations:** This is a list of outliers, not a central tendency. It shows what is possible under ideal conditions but doesn't provide a strong probabilistic base for a typical season's maximum.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-11-07 (or earlier):** Cam Little kicks a 68-yard FG in a regular season game. — ↑ (Large) — This sets a new NFL record and establishes the *floor* for the final resolution value. The question is now whether a kick *longer than 68 yards* will occur.
*   **2025-10-03 (or earlier):** Reports note two FGs of 64 and 65 yards were made in the first four weeks of the season. — ↑ (Moderate) — Confirms a league-wide environment conducive to long-range kicks, suggesting the 68-yarder is not a complete anomaly but part of a broader trend.
*   **2025-09-02:** NFL confirms a rule change allowing teams to practice with "kicking balls" (K-balls) all week. — ↑ (Moderate) — Provides a plausible causal mechanism for increased maximum distances, as kickers can better "break in" and understand the specific balls used in games.
*   **2025-08-13:** Cam Little kicks a 70-yard FG in a preseason game. — ↑ (Large) — Demonstrates that at least one kicker has the raw leg strength to break the new 68-yard record under game-like (though not regular season) conditions.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Kicker Specialization & Talent:** Kickers are entering the league with more specialized training and greater leg strength than previous generations. This is a secular trend driving records higher. (Large)
2.  **"K-Ball" Rule Change:** The ability to prepare the game balls allows kickers to optimize them for flight, potentially adding 1-3 yards of effective range on maximal attempts. This is a new mechanism for the 2025 season. (Moderate)
3.  **Altitude Advantage:** Games played at high altitude (primarily Denver) significantly reduce air resistance, allowing for longer kicks. Historically, many long kicks have occurred in Denver. (Large, but situational)
4.  **Game Situation:** The vast majority of record-length attempts occur at the very end of a half or game, when a low-probability attempt is the only option. The frequency of these specific situations creates opportunities. (Large driver of *attempts*)
5.  **Increased Analytical Acceptance:** Coaches are more willing to attempt long FGs based on analytics, slightly increasing the number of opportunities for a record-breaking kick compared to a decade ago. (Small)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Record Already Broken:** Unlike any previous season in the reference class (except 2013 and 2021), the all-time NFL record has *already* been broken mid-season. The baseline for the final outcome is 68 yards, a value that exceeds the maximum of all but one season in history.
*   **Demonstrated 70-Yard Capability:** A specific kicker, Cam Little, has proven 70-yard range in a live preseason game. This provides a credible protagonist for a potential >68 yard kick, which is a stronger signal than just a general trend.
*   **New K-Ball Rule:** The 2025 season is the first under the new rule allowing kickers to prepare their game balls. This is a structural change not present in the historical data, providing a physical reason to expect longer kicks.
*   **Early Season Clustering:** The occurrence of multiple 64+ yard FGs early in the season (including the 68-yard record) suggests the 2025 environment is uniquely favorable for long kicks, more so than the simple trendline from the base rate would predict.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A prior based on the 2015-2024 trend might be a distribution centered around 64.5 yards with significant variance, acknowledging the upward trend (equivalent n of ~10).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   **↑ (Large):** The fact that a 68-yard FG has already been made. This is dispositive evidence that truncates the distribution, setting a hard floor at 68. The entire probability mass below 68 is shifted to 68 or higher.
    *   **↑ (Large):** Cam Little's 70-yard preseason FG. This strongly updates the probability of the *maximum possible* distance, making a 69 or 70-yard kick seem plausible, not just theoretical.
    *   **↑ (Moderate):** The new K-ball rule. This provides a causal reason to believe the entire distribution of maximum kick distances has shifted upward this season.
    *   **↑ (Small):** Multiple other 64+ yard kicks this season. This corroborates that the environment is favorable and the 68-yarder wasn't a complete fluke.
*   **Net effect:** The posterior distribution should be dramatically different from the prior. It should have a point mass at 68 yards representing the probability that no longer kick is made, and a right tail with non-trivial probabilities for 69 and 70 yards, and rapidly decaying probabilities thereafter. The mean of the posterior will be slightly above 68.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Any team with a strong-legged kicker (Jaguars, Ravens, Broncos) playing a game in Denver.
    *   A close game involving one of these kickers that is tied or within 3 points in the final seconds of a half or the game.
    *   Media reports or practice footage of kickers successfully making kicks from 68+ yards in practice.
    *   Ideal weather conditions (warm, low wind, or tailwind) in games featuring elite kickers.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Injuries to key long-range kickers (e.g., Cam Little, Justin Tucker, Wil Lutz).
    *   Games in Denver being played in cold, snowy, or windy conditions.
    *   Teams with strong-legged kickers consistently being in blowouts (win or lose), reducing the chance of a desperation end-of-game attempt.
    *   A sudden league-wide drop-off in 55+ yard FG success rates, suggesting the early season was an anomaly.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Rarity of Attempts:** Kicks over 65 yards are exceptionally rare. The final outcome depends on a specific, low-probability game script occurring, even if the physical capability exists.
*   **Weather Unpredictability:** A single gust of wind can be the difference between a make and a miss from this distance. Weather for the remaining ~6 weeks of the season is a major unknown.
*   **Coaching Conservatism:** Despite analytics, many coaches would rather attempt a Hail Mary pass than a 68+ yard FG, limiting opportunities.
*   **The "K-Ball" Narrative:** The effect of the K-ball rule change may be overstated. The background notes that overall 50+ yard FG% is not up, suggesting the rule's impact might be confined to the absolute maximum distance rather than general accuracy.
*   **Resolution Floor:** The question resolves to the *longest* kick. The current 68-yarder is the floor. Forecasters must not predict a value lower than this. The uncertainty is only on the upside.

**Final Research Summary:** The current record for the 2025 season is already an NFL-record 68 yards, setting a floor for this question's resolution. The key uncertainty is the probability of an even longer kick, which is non-trivial given a demonstrated 70-yard preseason kick by the new record-holder and a new rule favoring kickers.

To forecast the longest field goal of the 2025 NFL season, we will follow a structured Bayesian approach:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - **Reference Class:** Longest field goals per NFL regular season from 2015-2024.
   - **Base Rate:** The median is 61.5 yards, and the mean is 61.7 yards, with a clear upward trend. The trend suggests a baseline in the 63-65 yard range for 2025.
   - **Variance:** Given the historical data, there is significant variance, with recent years showing longer kicks.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - **Similarity:** The trend of increasing field goal lengths continues, with recent seasons showing longer kicks.
   - **Difference:** The 2025 season has already seen a 68-yard field goal, setting a new record, and a 70-yard kick in preseason, indicating a shift in potential maximums.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **68-yard FG:** Sets a new record, indicating a higher baseline for the season.
   - **70-yard Preseason FG:** Demonstrates potential for even longer kicks.
   - **K-Ball Rule Change:** Allows kickers to better prepare, potentially increasing maximum distances.
   - **Multiple 64+ Yard Kicks:** Suggests a conducive environment for long kicks.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - **Prior:** Centered around 64.5 yards.
   - **Evidence:** The 68-yard FG shifts the distribution's floor to 68 yards. The 70-yard preseason kick and K-ball rule shift the distribution's tail upwards.
   - **Posterior Mean:** Slightly above 68 yards, with a right-skewed distribution allowing for longer kicks.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the rarity of 68+ yard attempts and the impact of weather and game situations.
   - **Alternative Scenarios:** A sudden drop in kicker performance or adverse weather could limit longer kicks.
   - **Adjustment:** Ensure the distribution accounts for these risks, maintaining a realistic probability for 69-70 yard kicks.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Given the evidence and adjustments, the percentiles for the longest field goal of the 2025 NFL season are:

P10: 68  
P20: 68  
P40: 68  
P60: 69  
P80: 69  
P90: 70

# Forecasting the Longest Field Goal of the 2025 NFL Season

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll use two reference classes to establish my prior:
1. **Longest field goal per NFL season (2015-2024)**: 61, 57, 61, 59, 63, 65, 66, 62, 61, 62 yards
2. **All-time longest field goals in NFL history (pre-2025)**: 66 (Tucker, 2021), 64 (Prater, 2013), 63 (multiple kickers)

The mean of the 2015-2024 data is 61.7 yards with a standard deviation of ~2.5 yards. However, there's a clear upward trend, with the three longest kicks (63, 65, 66) occurring in the last 6 years.

I'll use a prior centered around 64-65 yards, reflecting the recent upward trend in maximum field goal distances. This prior would typically have a right-skewed distribution, as breaking records becomes exponentially harder.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- The physical limitations of human kicking ability remain relatively constant
- Game situations that lead to extremely long attempts (end of half/game) occur with similar frequency
- Elite kickers (like Justin Tucker) are still active in the league

**Differences from base case:**
- A 68-yard field goal has already been made in the 2025 regular season, establishing a floor for our forecast
- The new "K-ball" rule allows kickers to practice with game balls all week, potentially adding 1-3 yards to maximum range
- Cam Little has demonstrated 70-yard capability in preseason, showing the physical possibility of exceeding the current record
- Multiple 64+ yard field goals early in the 2025 season suggest a more favorable environment for long kicks

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence for longer kicks (>68 yards):**
- Cam Little's 70-yard preseason field goal demonstrates the physical capability exists (strong evidence, ~3:1 likelihood ratio favoring a kick ≥69 yards)
- The new K-ball rule provides a plausible mechanism for increased distances (moderate evidence, ~2:1 likelihood ratio)
- Multiple 64+ yard kicks early in the season suggest a favorable environment (weak evidence, ~1.5:1 likelihood ratio)

**Evidence against longer kicks (>68 yards):**
- The 68-yard kick may have occurred under ideal conditions that won't be replicated (moderate counterevidence, ~1:1.5 likelihood ratio)
- Overall 50+ yard FG percentage isn't significantly higher than 2024, suggesting limited impact of the K-ball rule (weak counterevidence, ~1:1.2 likelihood ratio)
- Extremely long attempts (68+ yards) remain rare game situations (moderate counterevidence, ~1:1.5 likelihood ratio)

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with my prior centered around 64-65 yards, I need to make a major update: the 68-yard kick already made in 2025 truncates my distribution at 68 yards. All probability mass below 68 yards must be shifted to 68 or higher.

**First update - 68-yard floor:**
- Prior: centered at ~65 yards with significant mass below 68
- Update: 100% of probability mass must be at 68 or higher
- Interim posterior: point mass at 68 yards (~60-70%) with remaining probability spread across higher values

**Second update - 70-yard preseason kick:**
- Interim posterior: point mass at 68 yards (~60-70%) with thin tail above
- Update: Demonstrated 70-yard capability increases plausibility of 69-70 yard kicks
- New posterior: point mass at 68 yards (~50-60%) with more substantial probability at 69-70 yards

**Third update - K-ball rule and multiple long kicks:**
- Further shifts some probability mass from 68 yards to the 69-71 yard range
- Final posterior: ~50% at 68 yards, ~30% at 69 yards, ~15% at 70 yards, ~5% at 71+ yards

The posterior mean is approximately 68.8 yards, with a right-skewed distribution.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overestimating the impact of the K-ball rule if its effects are primarily psychological rather than physical
- I might be underestimating the rarity of game situations that would lead to attempts beyond 68 yards
- Weather conditions for remaining games could be unfavorable for long kicks (cold weather, wind)

**Alternative forecast:**
A more conservative forecast would place ~70-80% probability on 68 yards, arguing that:
1. The 68-yard kick was already an outlier
2. Few games remain in the season to break this record
3. Ideal conditions (Denver altitude, perfect weather) may not align with games featuring strong-legged kickers

**Rebuttal to alternative:**
While valid concerns, the demonstrated 70-yard capability in preseason and multiple 64+ yard kicks early in the season provide strong evidence that the environment is uniquely favorable for long kicks in 2025.

**Adjustment:**
I'll slightly increase my probability at 68 yards to account for the limited remaining opportunities and weather uncertainty.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The primary base rate is the longest field goal made per NFL regular season in the modern era. Using data from the last 10 seasons (2015-2024), we have the following distances in yards: 61, 57, 61, 59, 63, 65, 66, 62, 61, 62.

*   **Distribution**: This dataset has a median of 61.5 yards and a mean of 61.7 yards.
*   **Rationale**: This period captures the modern specialization of kickers. However, there is a clear upward trend, with the three longest kicks in this sample (66, 65, 63 yards) all occurring since 2019. A simple trend extrapolation would suggest a prior centered around 63-64 yards for the 2025 season, with a standard deviation of 2-3 yards, acknowledging the year-to-year variance.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The 2025 season is fundamentally different from the base rate period due to several critical factors:

*   **Similarity**: The underlying game situations that prompt long field goal attempts (i.e., end of a half or game with no time for another play) remain the same.
*   **Difference (Structural)**: A new rule for 2025 allows teams to practice with the designated "kicking balls" (K-balls) all week. This provides a physical mechanism for kickers to "break in" the balls, potentially increasing maximum kicking distance. This is a structural change not present in the historical data.
*   **Difference (Dispositive Evidence)**: The most significant difference is that a **68-yard field goal has already been kicked** by Cam Little in the 2025 regular season. This is an NFL record and sets a hard *floor* for the final answer. The forecasting problem is no longer "What will be the longest kick?" but rather "What is the probability that a kick *longer than 68 yards* will be made in the remainder of the season?"

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
Several pieces of evidence from the 2025 season require a massive update from the prior.

*   **Evidence 1: 68-yard FG already made.** This is dispositive. It truncates the entire distribution, shifting all probability mass to 68 yards or greater. The likelihood of any value less than 68 is zero.
*   **Evidence 2: Cam Little's 70-yard preseason FG.** This is extremely strong evidence. While a preseason game has less pressure, it demonstrates that a specific player has the raw leg strength and technique to surpass the new 68-yard record under live, game-like conditions. This makes outcomes of 69 or 70 yards plausible, not just theoretical. This evidence dramatically increases the weight in the right tail of the distribution (>68 yards).
*   **Evidence 3: New "K-ball" rule.** This provides a causal explanation for the observed increase in maximum distances, reinforcing the idea that 2025 is a new regime. It increases our confidence that the 68-yarder was not a complete anomaly and that further records are more likely than in past seasons.
*   **Evidence 4: Multiple other long FGs (64, 65 yards) early in the season.** This corroborates that the overall environment is favorable for long kicks. It suggests that the potential for a record-breaking kick is not solely dependent on one player (Cam Little), slightly increasing the number of potential opportunities league-wide.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
*   **Prior**: A distribution centered around ~63.5 yards.
*   **Update Step**: The observation of a 68-yard field goal renders the prior obsolete. We must construct a new posterior distribution conditional on this fact. The new distribution has a floor of 68 yards. The question becomes how to allocate probability between the outcome being exactly 68 and the outcome being greater than 68.
*   **Posterior Shape**: The evidence (especially the 70-yard preseason kick) suggests a non-trivial probability of the record being broken again. However, breaking an all-time record twice in one season is a very rare event. Opportunities for 69+ yard attempts are scarce and depend on specific game situations, coaching decisions, and weather. Therefore, the posterior distribution will have a large point mass at 68 yards (representing the scenario where the record is not broken again) and a right tail with decreasing probabilities for 69, 70, and 71+ yards.
*   **Quantification**: I estimate roughly a 70% chance that 68 yards remains the longest kick of the season. The remaining 30% is the probability of a longer kick. This 30% is distributed primarily across 69 and 70 yards, given the demonstrated 70-yard capability.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
*   **Overconfidence/Risk**: Am I over-weighting the 70-yard preseason kick and the "K-ball" narrative? As winter approaches, weather conditions will worsen for many teams, reducing opportunities. An injury to a key long-legged kicker like Cam Little would also significantly decrease the probability of a >68 yard kick. Coaching conservatism remains a major barrier to attempts.
*   **Alternative Forecast**: A more conservative forecast would place a much higher probability (e.g., 85-90%) on 68 yards holding as the record. This view would argue that the 68-yarder was the season's major outlier event, and a second, even larger outlier is extremely unlikely.
*   **Adjustment**: My initial 60% probability for the record holding felt too low. The combination of worsening weather, potential injuries, and the sheer rarity of such events warrants a more conservative stance. I have adjusted the probability that 68 yards holds to 70%, which acknowledges the significant possibility of a new record while respecting the difficulty. This leads to a distribution where the median is 68, but the upper percentiles (P80, P90) reflect the plausible, but not probable, scenarios of a 69 or 70-yard kick.

### 6. Final Percentiles
My final distribution assigns approximately a 70% probability that the longest field goal will be exactly 68 yards, an 18% chance of it being 69 yards, a 9% chance of it being 70 yards, and a 3% chance of it being 71 yards or longer. This translates to the following percentiles.

P10: 68
P20: 68
P40: 68
P60: 68
P80: 69
P90: 70
