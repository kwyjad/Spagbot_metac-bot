### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Canadian MP Departures (Resignation, Floor Crossing, Becoming Independent) per Parliament:** In a typical four-year Canadian parliament (338 MPs), there are roughly 10-15 such events. This yields a rate of approximately 2.5-3.75 events per year. For the ~1.5-month resolution window (approx. 1/8th of a year), this suggests a naive base rate of **30-45%** for at least one event occurring. This class is broad but provides a reasonable starting point for the raw frequency of such events.
2.  **Departures in Minority Parliaments:** The rate of politically-motivated departures, especially floor crossings, is higher during contentious minority parliaments. The 2004-2006 Paul Martin minority government saw the high-profile defection of Belinda Stronach, which was crucial for the government's survival. This reference class suggests that when the balance of power is precarious, the likelihood of such events increases. The base rate from this class is likely higher, perhaps in the **40-60%** range for a similar period under such conditions, though the sample size is small.
3.  **Post-Election "Musical Chairs":** It is not uncommon for a flurry of political adjustments to occur in the months immediately following a federal election, as MPs reassess their roles, party leadership solidifies its position, and new political realities set in. This reference class focuses on the specific timing. However, the fictional election was in 2025, and we are now in November, suggesting this initial period may be closing. This class doesn't strongly modify the base rate but supports the idea of clustered events.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   [2025-11-06] Conservative MP Matt Jeneroux resigns, reportedly after being warned of "consequences" for considering a floor crossing. — ↑ — This signals that d'Entremont was not an isolated case of discontent and that the Conservative party is now applying intense internal pressure, which can be a volatile and unpredictable strategy.
*   [2025-11-05] Conservative MP Chris d'Entremont crosses the floor to the Liberals, citing disagreement with party leadership. — ↑ — This event is a powerful catalyst. It breaks the "taboo" of defection for the current caucus, provides a public narrative for others to follow, and moves the Liberals demonstrably closer to a majority, increasing their incentive to recruit more.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Liberal Government's Quest for a Majority (Large ↑):** The primary driver. The ability to form a majority government by recruiting just two more MPs is an enormous prize, granting stability, legislative control, and the ability to govern for a full term. The government is almost certainly actively identifying and making significant offers (e.g., cabinet positions, parliamentary secretary roles, policy influence) to potential defectors.
2.  **Conservative Party Internal Dissent (Large ↑):** The background explicitly cites d'Entremont's disagreement with Pierre Poilievre's leadership. This suggests a potential ideological or stylistic rift within the Conservative caucus (e.g., between populist and more moderate/Red Tory factions). Where one MP is openly disaffected, others are likely to be privately so.
3.  **Conservative Party Discipline as a Catalyst (Moderate ↑/↓):** The reported threat of "consequences" against Jeneroux is a double-edged sword. It may intimidate some MPs into staying in line (↓). However, for an MP already feeling alienated, such a threat can be the final push, making them feel they have no future in the party and nothing left to lose by leaving (↑).
4.  **Political "Momentum" and Social Proof (Moderate ↑):** D'Entremont's defection creates a pathway that is easier for others to follow. The media attention and political narrative make it a live possibility rather than a theoretical one. This lowers the psychological barrier for a second or third MP to make a similar move.
5.  **Limited Time Window Before Holiday Recess (Small ↑):** The House of Commons typically rises for its winter break in mid-December. Any MP wishing to make a politically impactful move (like a defection to save the government on a budget vote) has a strong incentive to do so in the next few weeks. This concentrates the probability within the resolution window.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Proximity to a Majority:** Unlike a typical minority government, the Liberals are on the absolute cusp of a majority (2 seats away). This dramatically raises the stakes and the incentive for the government to actively engineer an outcome, a factor not present in most of the base rate data.
*   **A "Live" Precedent:** The base rate averages events over long periods. Here, a defection and a forced resignation have happened *in the last week*. This indicates an acute, ongoing political crisis, not a background statistical probability. The situation is hot.
*   **Explicit Leadership-Based Dissent:** While party dissent is common, d'Entremont's public rationale was a direct critique of the leader. This provides a specific, repeatable justification for other ideologically-aligned MPs to use, making a departure less of a pure "betrayal" and more of a "principled stand."
*   **Active Recruitment vs. Passive Departure:** The base rate includes many resignations for personal/health reasons or appointments to other posts (e.g., Senate). The current situation is dominated by the mechanism of active recruitment by one party and dissent in another, suggesting a much higher likelihood of politically-motivated events.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A reasonable prior, based on the reference class of departures in contentious minority parliaments, might be P(Yes) ≈ 0.45, with a moderate strength (equivalent n ≈ 15).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   ↑ (Large): The government is only two seats from a majority, creating a powerful incentive for action.
    *   ↑ (Large): The d'Entremont defection and Jeneroux resignation confirm a live, active dynamic of dissent and recruitment.
    *   ↑ (Moderate): The public rationale of leadership dissent provides a ready-made narrative for other potential defectors.
    *   ↑/↓ (Small): The CPC's "hardball" tactics could either suppress or accelerate further departures.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly suggests the current situation is far more volatile than the reference class. The posterior probability should move significantly upward from the prior.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Rumors or reports of specific Conservative MPs meeting with Liberal officials.
    *   A Conservative MP making public statements that are unusually complimentary of the government's budget or critical of their own party's strategy.
    *   An MP from any party unexpectedly absenting themselves from key votes or caucus meetings.
    *   Vague statements from the Prime Minister's Office about "welcoming all who share our values."
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   A public, unified statement of loyalty to Pierre Poilievre signed by the entire Conservative caucus.
    *   The Liberal government securing a deal with another opposition party (e.g., NDP, Bloc) to pass the budget, reducing the urgency for a majority.
    *   Key potential Conservative defectors being given prominent new roles within the party.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Fictional Scenario:** The analysis is based entirely on the provided fictional background. Real-world political dynamics involve complex personal relationships and historical grievances not captured here.
*   **Unpredictability of Individual Choice:** The decision to resign or cross the floor is ultimately a personal one. It can be influenced by factors invisible to the public, such as family pressure, health, or a sudden private-sector job offer.
*   **Information Control:** All parties involved have a strong incentive to manage information. The government will conduct negotiations in secret, and the opposition will project an image of unity, regardless of the internal reality. Public signals may be misleading.
*   **Resolution Window Specificity:** The question resolves on Dec 31, 2025. An MP could announce on Dec 20th their intention to resign effective Jan 2nd, 2026, which would not trigger a "Yes" resolution. The exact timing is critical.

**Final Research Summary:** The confluence of a government on the verge of a majority, a clear precedent for defection, and active internal dissent within the opposition makes the current situation exceptionally volatile; the probability of another MP departure before year-end is substantially higher than the historical base rate.

To forecast the probability of another Canadian MP defecting or resigning before 2026, we will follow the structured Bayesian reasoning process.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate for Canadian MP departures (resignations, floor crossings, becoming independent) in a typical four-year parliament is approximately 10-15 events, translating to 2.5-3.75 events per year. For the 1.5-month resolution window, this suggests a naive base rate of 30-45% for at least one event occurring.
   - Given the context of a minority government and recent defections, the base rate for politically motivated departures in minority parliaments is higher, around 40-60%. We'll use 50% as a reasonable prior probability, reflecting the increased likelihood in a contentious minority government.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The current situation involves a minority government, which historically sees higher rates of defections and resignations.
   - Differences: The Liberals are just two seats away from a majority, creating a strong incentive for further defections. Recent events (d'Entremont's defection and Jeneroux's resignation) indicate active political maneuvering, which is not typical in the base case.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Government's Quest for a Majority:** The incentive for the Liberals to recruit more MPs is high, increasing the likelihood of defections. (P(E | H) > P(E | ~H))
   - **Conservative Party Internal Dissent:** Discontent with leadership suggests potential for more defections. (P(E | H) > P(E | ~H))
   - **Conservative Party Discipline:** Threats of consequences could either deter or provoke defections. (Mixed impact)
   - **Recent Defections:** The recent defection and resignation suggest a volatile situation. (P(E | H) > P(E | ~H))

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Prior odds: 1:1 (50% prior probability)
   - Likelihood ratio: Given the strong evidence of political maneuvering and dissent, we estimate a likelihood ratio of approximately 2:1 in favor of another defection or resignation.
   - Posterior odds: 1:1 × 2:1 = 2:1
   - Posterior probability: 2 / (2 + 1) = 2/3 ≈ 66.7%

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence risk: The forecast might overestimate the likelihood if internal party discipline is more effective than anticipated.
   - Alternative scenario: The Conservatives could unify and prevent further defections, or the Liberals might secure a deal with another party, reducing the need for defections.
   - Adjustments: Consider the possibility of unexpected events or strategic moves by parties that could alter the dynamics.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Considering the base rate, evidence, and potential alternative scenarios, the final forecast is adjusted slightly to account for uncertainties and potential overconfidence.

Final: 65%

# Will another Canadian MP defect or resign before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to establish a base rate for MP defections or resignations in a short timeframe (approximately 40 days from Nov 21 to Dec 31, 2025).

The most appropriate reference class is the rate of MP departures (resignations, floor crossings, becoming independent) in minority parliaments, particularly when the governing party is close to achieving a majority.

Based on historical patterns in Canadian politics:
- In a typical four-year parliament with 338 MPs, there are roughly 10-15 departures
- This translates to approximately 2.5-3.75 events per year
- For a ~40-day window (about 1/9 of a year), this would suggest a base rate of around 28-42%

However, the current situation is a minority parliament with heightened political tension, which typically sees more departures. In such contexts, the rate might be 40-60% for a similar period.

Given these considerations, I'll set a prior probability of **45%**.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- This is a minority parliament, which historically sees more floor crossings and resignations
- There are ideological tensions within the opposition party (Conservatives)
- The timing is post-election, when MPs often reassess their political futures

**Key differences:**
- The Liberals are exceptionally close to a majority (just 2 seats away)
- Two MPs have already left the Conservative caucus in the past week (one defection, one resignation)
- There are explicit reports of active recruitment and pressure tactics
- The Conservative leadership is reportedly threatening "consequences" for potential defectors
- The timing is near year-end and a budget vote, creating heightened political stakes

These differences significantly increase the likelihood compared to the base rate.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Chris d'Entremont's floor crossing (Nov 5)**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.9) - If more defections are coming, we'd expect to see initial defections
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.4) - Even if no more defections occur, this one could happen in isolation
- Likelihood ratio: ~2.25
- This significantly increases the probability, as it establishes a precedent and indicates internal Conservative discord

**Evidence 2: Matt Jeneroux's resignation (Nov 6)**
- P(E|H): High (~0.8) - If more departures are coming, we'd expect to see clustering
- P(E|~H): Low-moderate (~0.3) - Two departures in two days is unusual if this is the end of the pattern
- Likelihood ratio: ~2.67
- This further increases probability, suggesting an ongoing pattern rather than isolated incidents

**Evidence 3: Liberals being just 2 seats from majority**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.95) - The incentive structure strongly favors active recruitment
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.5) - This situation could exist without causing additional defections
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.9
- This increases probability as it creates strong motivation for the Liberals to recruit and for dissatisfied Conservatives to defect

**Evidence 4: Reports of "consequences" for potential defectors**
- P(E|H): High (~0.8) - Harsh tactics often backfire and can accelerate departures
- P(E|~H): Moderate-high (~0.6) - Such tactics might successfully prevent further defections
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.33
- This moderately increases probability, as pressure tactics can push wavering MPs to leave

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 45:55 (0.45/(1-0.45) = 0.818)

First update (d'Entremont's defection):
- Posterior odds = 0.818 × 2.25 = 1.84
- Posterior probability = 1.84/(1+1.84) = 0.648 (64.8%)

Second update (Jeneroux's resignation):
- Posterior odds = 1.84 × 2.67 = 4.91
- Posterior probability = 4.91/(1+4.91) = 0.831 (83.1%)

Third update (Liberals close to majority):
- Posterior odds = 4.91 × 1.9 = 9.33
- Posterior probability = 9.33/(1+9.33) = 0.903 (90.3%)

Fourth update (Conservative pressure tactics):
- Posterior odds = 9.33 × 1.33 = 12.41
- Posterior probability = 12.41/(1+12.41) = 0.925 (92.5%)

## 5. Red Team Thinking

Potential blind spots in my analysis:

1. **Overestimating momentum**: I may be overweighting the clustering effect. The two departures might represent the entirety of dissatisfied MPs.

2. **Conservative countermeasures**: The Conservative leadership, now alerted to the threat, might offer incentives (committee positions, policy concessions) to retain wavering MPs.

3. **Timing constraints**: The holiday recess could delay any further actions until January 2026, pushing potential defections outside the resolution window.

4. **Alternative political solutions**: The Liberals might secure support from other parties (NDP, Bloc) for their budget, reducing the urgency to recruit Conservative MPs.

5. **Overconfidence in my likelihood ratios**: My estimates of conditional probabilities may be too extreme given the limited information.

Considering these factors, I should adjust my probability downward from 92.5%. A more calibrated estimate would be around 80-85%.

## 6. Final Forecast

After considering the base rate, the specific evidence, and potential blind spots, I believe there is a high probability that another Canadian MP will defect or resign before 2026. The clustering of recent departures, the Liberals' proximity to a majority, and the reported internal tensions within the Conservative Party all point strongly toward additional departures.

However, I need to account for the possibility that the two recent departures represent the full extent of the vulnerable MPs, and that Conservative leadership will take effective measures to prevent further losses.

Final: 82%

Here is a probabilistic forecast following the specified methodology.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The event in question is whether another Canadian MP will defect or resign within a specific ~6-week window (Nov 18 - Dec 31, 2025).

I will select a base rate based on the reference class of "departures in contentious minority parliaments." A standard parliament sees about 2.5-3.75 departures per year, which would suggest a ~30-40% chance for a 6-week period. However, minority governments, especially those with a precarious balance of power, are inherently more volatile. The research report notes the high-profile defection during the 2004-2006 Paul Martin minority government, which was crucial for its survival. This specific context of high stakes and instability suggests a significantly elevated base rate.

Therefore, I will set the prior probability P(H) at **50%**. This reflects a belief that, in any given 6-week period during a highly contentious minority government, there is an even chance of at least one politically motivated departure. This corresponds to prior odds of 1:1.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation differs from the general base case of a "contentious minority parliament" in several critical ways that amplify the probability of an event:

*   **Proximity to a Majority:** The Liberal government is just two seats away from a majority. This is an exceptionally rare and high-stakes situation. Unlike a typical minority government seeking ad-hoc support, the Liberals have a clear, achievable path to stable, long-term power. This provides them with an enormous incentive to actively recruit defectors, an activity not present in most historical examples.
*   **Immediate Precedent:** The base rate is an average over time. The current situation is "hot." A defection and a forced resignation have occurred in the past week. This indicates that the underlying causes of dissent are active *now*, and it creates momentum by breaking the taboo of defection and providing a public narrative for others to follow.
*   **Active Crisis vs. Background Risk:** The base rate reflects a background risk of departures. The current scenario is an active political crisis centered on Conservative party leadership and unity, being exploited by a government on the cusp of a majority. This is a qualitatively different and more volatile dynamic.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
Let H be the hypothesis that another MP defects or resigns before 2026.

*   **Evidence 1: The Liberals are two seats from a majority.**
    *   This evidence is much more likely if a defection is being planned (P(E|H) is high) because this strategic prize is the primary motivation for the government to make irresistible offers. It is less likely that such a tempting situation would result in no further action (P(E|~H) is lower).
    *   **Likelihood Ratio (LR): > 1 (Strongly increases probability).** This is the main driver of the scenario.

*   **Evidence 2: The recent defection of d'Entremont and resignation of Jeneroux.**
    *   These events are highly indicative of a broader internal conflict. Political departures are often clustered; the first one lowers the barrier for others. This "social proof" and the evidence of active turmoil make another departure more likely (P(E|H) is high). It is less likely that these two events represent the entire scope of the dissent and that the issue is now fully resolved (P(E|~H) is lower).
    *   **Likelihood Ratio (LR): > 1 (Strongly increases probability).**

*   **Evidence 3: The Conservative Party is reportedly using threats of "consequences" to maintain discipline.**
    *   This is a double-edged sword. While it may intimidate some, the very need for such tactics reveals deep disunity. For an MP already feeling alienated, a threat can be the final push, confirming they have no future in the party. It signals a reactive and potentially fragile leadership. Therefore, it slightly favors the hypothesis that the situation is unstable and another departure is likely.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio (LR): > 1 (Slightly increases probability).**

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
I will conceptually update the prior based on the evidence.

*   **Prior Odds:** 1:1 (from 50% probability).
*   **Update 1 (Proximity to Majority):** The immense strategic incentive for the Liberals is a powerful factor. I estimate a likelihood ratio of ~2.0 for this evidence.
    *   Posterior Odds = 1 * 2.0 = 2:1. (Probability is now ~67%).
*   **Update 2 (Recent Events & Momentum):** The fact that two events just happened is another strong signal that the situation is live and volatile. I estimate a likelihood ratio of ~1.8 for this evidence.
    *   Posterior Odds = 2 * 1.8 = 3.6:1. (Probability is now ~78%).
*   **Update 3 (CPC Tactics):** The evidence of internal threats is a weaker signal but points towards instability. I'll use a small LR of ~1.1.
    *   Posterior Odds = 3.6 * 1.1 = 3.96:1.
    *   This corresponds to a final probability of 3.96 / (1 + 3.96) ≈ 80%.

The calculation suggests a high probability. I will moderate this slightly to account for uncertainties.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
A strong counterargument is the "lanced boil" theory: d'Entremont and Jeneroux were the only serious dissenters, and with them gone, the Conservative caucus will now unify against the external threat. The party leadership, now alerted to the danger, will work effectively to shore up support and prevent any further departures. Furthermore, the ~6-week time window is short, and a potential defector might choose to wait until the new year.

However, this seems less likely than the "tip of the iceberg" scenario. Leadership-based dissent is rarely confined to just one or two individuals in a large caucus. The immense pressure and incentives from the Liberal side are likely to find other weak points in the Conservative armor, especially with the budget vote acting as a near-term forcing function.

While the red team arguments are plausible and prevent a forecast of >90%, the weight of the evidence points strongly towards another event. I will adjust my posterior down from 80% to the high 70s to reflect these counter-possibilities.

### 6. Final Forecast
The base rate for a departure in a contentious minority government is already significant (P~50%). The specific evidence in this scenario—the government being on the cusp of a majority, a successful recent defection creating a precedent, and signs of internal turmoil in the opposition—all point to a situation that is far more volatile than the base case. The incentives for the government to recruit and for a disaffected MP to leave are currently at a peak. While the opposition will surely mount a strong defense to prevent further losses, the momentum appears to favor another departure occurring before the end of the year.

Final: 78%
