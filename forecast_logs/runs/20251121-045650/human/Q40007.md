### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Post-Crisis Nuclear Negotiations with Iran (2003-Present):** This class includes instances where Iran negotiated with the P5+1 and/or the IAEA following a period of heightened tension (e.g., new sanctions, discovery of undeclared sites, threats of military action). In these cases, Iran typically engages in a protracted process of brinkmanship, using concessions on access as a bargaining chip. Quick resolutions (<3 months) are rare. A ballpark base rate for Iran making a significant concession on nuclear access within three months of a major crisis event is low, perhaps **15-25%**. This is derived from observing the multi-year timelines of negotiations leading to the JCPOA and the lengthy stalemates that have characterized other periods.
2.  **Adversarial State Concessions After Direct Military Strikes:** This class involves states making diplomatic concessions shortly after being targeted by significant, overt military action from a major power. Historically, the immediate aftermath of such a strike often produces a "rally 'round the flag" effect, hardening the target's position to avoid appearing weak. Concessions are more likely after a longer "cooling off" period or if the strikes are perceived as a precursor to a much larger, regime-threatening campaign. The base rate for a significant concession within three months is very low, likely **<10%**.
3.  **IAEA-Iran Technical Agreements:** This class covers the numerous smaller agreements on specific access or monitoring issues. These often succeed, but they typically concern less politically sensitive issues than accounting for a large stockpile of 60% enriched uranium in facilities just destroyed by the US. The base rate for success is higher (~50%), but the context is not directly comparable, making this a weaker reference class.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-06-22** US B-2 bombers strike Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan nuclear sites. — ↓ — Establishes a new, highly confrontational baseline, making Iranian cooperation a politically costly concession.
*   **2025-06-25** Iranian parliament votes to suspend all IAEA cooperation. — ↓ — Formalizes Iran's defiant posture and creates a legal/political barrier to resuming inspections.
*   **2025-09-09** Iran and IAEA announce a deal to resume inspections at bombed sites. — ↑ — A significant, albeit brief, signal that a pragmatic path to de-escalation and verification was possible.
*   **2025-10-20** Iran announces the September 9th deal is void. — ↓ (large) — A major reversal, indicating that hardline domestic political forces have rejected compromise and the regime is willing to absorb further pressure.
*   **2025-11-19** IAEA confirms inspectors have returned to *unaffected* Iranian nuclear sites. — ↑ (small) — A minor concession by Iran to show it hasn't completely severed ties, but it avoids the core issue of the bombed sites and the enriched uranium stockpile.
*   **2025-11-20** IAEA Board of Governors passes a resolution demanding Iran provide immediate information. — ↑/↓ (net ↓) — Increases international diplomatic pressure (↑), but such resolutions often provoke defiance from Tehran, hardening its position in the short term (↓).
*   **2025-11-20** ISW reports Iran is willing to negotiate only if its right to enrich is guaranteed. — ↓ — Signals Iran is setting preconditions it knows are unacceptable to the US, indicating a lack of serious intent to reach a near-term agreement.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Regime Legitimacy & National Pride:** After a direct, humiliating US strike, the Iranian regime cannot be seen to capitulate quickly. Denying access is a way to project strength and defiance to both domestic and international audiences. (Large driver for NO).
2.  **Strategic Ambiguity & Leverage:** The uncertainty surrounding the status and location of the 400kg of 60% enriched uranium is Iran's primary bargaining chip. Allowing inspections would surrender this leverage for little perceived gain. (Large driver for NO).
3.  **Fear of Further Strikes:** If the regime believes that stonewalling will trigger another, more devastating round of attacks, it may grant access as a de-escalatory measure. This depends entirely on their perception of US/Israeli intent. (Moderate driver for YES).
4.  **Internal Political Dynamics:** The decision rests with the Supreme Leader, influenced by factions like the IRGC. Hardliners, empowered by the US attack, will resist any perceived concessions, while a pragmatic faction may push for a deal to alleviate economic and military pressure. The recent scrapping of the September deal suggests hardliners are dominant. (Moderate driver for NO).
5.  **International Diplomatic & Economic Pressure:** The unified front shown in the Nov 20 IAEA resolution, combined with ongoing sanctions, creates pressure on Tehran. However, Iran has demonstrated a high tolerance for economic pain and diplomatic isolation. (Small-to-moderate driver for YES).
6.  **Technical Pretext:** The physical destruction of the sites provides Iran with a plausible excuse for delays, claiming the areas are unsafe for inspectors or that accounting for the material amidst the rubble is technically impossible at present. (Moderate driver for NO).

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Direct US Kinetic Action:** Unlike past crises driven by sanctions or covert sabotage, this standoff follows a direct and overt US military attack. This fundamentally changes the political calculus for Iran, making any concession appear as a direct surrender to American military might.
*   **Physical Destruction of Facilities:** The reference class of "inspections" typically involves monitoring operational or intact sites. Here, the task is forensic accounting in a debris field, a technically and logistically novel challenge that Iran can easily use as a basis for obstruction.
*   **Known High-Value Target:** The IAEA's specific estimate of 400kg of 60% enriched uranium (a near-weapon-grade material) makes this a high-stakes verification task, not a routine inspection. The potential for material diversion is a primary concern for the international community, raising the stakes for both sides.
*   **Extremely Short Time Horizon:** The question resolves in ~40 days. The reference class shows that even minor agreements with Iran take months, if not years, to negotiate. A full reversal of its post-strike policy in such a short window would be exceptionally fast.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Starting from a base rate of post-crisis concessions (15-25%), a reasonable prior for a "Yes" resolution might be ~20% with a low "equivalent n" (e.g., n=10), reflecting the infrequency and high variance of such events.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   Direct US military strike on sovereign territory: ↓ (large)
    *   Iran's explicit scrapping of the September inspection deal: ↓ (large)
    *   Iran's public negotiation posture (demanding enrichment rights): ↓ (moderate)
    *   Recent IAEA resolution increasing pressure: ↑ (small)
    *   Allowing inspections at *unaffected* sites: ↑ (small)
*   **Net effect:** The evidence since the June strike, particularly the October reversal, points overwhelmingly toward a hardline, non-cooperative stance. The posterior probability for "Yes" should be revised significantly downward from the already low prior.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators (suggesting YES is more likely):**
    *   Reports of secret back-channel talks, likely mediated by Oman or Qatar.
    *   Statements from Iranian officials emphasizing the need for de-escalation or economic stability over nuclear defiance.
    *   A sudden, verifiable halt in all other enrichment activities as a confidence-building measure.
    *   Unusual high-level meetings between Iranian and European/IAEA officials.
*   **DOWN indicators (suggesting NO is more likely):**
    *   Escalatory rhetoric from the Supreme Leader or IRGC commanders vowing revenge or resistance.
    *   Announcements of new progress in Iran's nuclear program at other, undamaged sites.
    *   Iran formally blaming the US/Israel for making the sites "permanently unsafe" for inspection.
    *   Military drills or hostile actions by Iranian proxies in the region.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Definitional Ambiguity:** An "agreement" could be a flimsy, non-binding statement of intent designed to relieve pressure without granting actual access. The resolution criteria ("to allow the IAEA to inspect") are fairly strong but could be tested by a phased or conditional agreement.
*   **Deception:** Iran could announce an agreement before the deadline with no intention of implementing it, securing a "Yes" resolution while continuing to delay access on the ground.
*   **Internal Power Shifts:** The analysis assumes a stable hardliner dominance. A sudden change in Iran's leadership or a severe domestic crisis (e.g., economic collapse, mass protests) could rapidly alter their strategic calculus.
*   **Technical Feasibility as a Smokescreen:** Iran's claims about the sites being unsafe may be legitimate, but they are also a convenient and difficult-to-refute excuse for indefinite delay.
*   **External Shocks:** A new, unrelated conflict in the region could divert international attention or change Iran's threat perception, altering its willingness to cooperate.

**Final Research Summary:**
The direct US military strike has made a rapid concession on nuclear inspections politically untenable for the Iranian regime. Recent events, especially the collapse of a prior agreement, confirm a hardline posture, making an announcement of renewed IAEA access before 2026 highly unlikely.

To forecast the probability of Iran allowing the IAEA to inspect its stockpile of enriched uranium before 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most relevant base rate is derived from the "Post-Crisis Nuclear Negotiations with Iran" reference class, which suggests a low probability (15-25%) of Iran making a significant concession on nuclear access within three months of a major crisis event. Given the current situation's heightened tensions and the historical context, a prior probability of 20% seems reasonable.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
**Similarities:**
- The situation involves post-crisis negotiations with Iran, similar to past instances where Iran used nuclear concessions as bargaining chips.
- The timeline is short, consistent with the reference class's observation of rare quick resolutions.

**Differences:**
- The direct military strike by the US is a significant escalation compared to previous crises, likely hardening Iran's stance.
- The physical destruction of nuclear sites adds complexity to the inspection process, providing Iran with a plausible reason for delay.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Direct US military strike:** This event likely decreases the probability of cooperation, as it strengthens Iran's resolve to resist appearing weak. (Likelihood ratio: ↓ large)
- **Iran's scrapping of the September deal:** Indicates a strong internal political shift towards non-cooperation. (Likelihood ratio: ↓ large)
- **Iran's negotiation posture (demanding enrichment rights):** Suggests a lack of serious intent to compromise. (Likelihood ratio: ↓ moderate)
- **IAEA resolution increasing pressure:** While it adds international pressure, Iran has historically resisted such measures. (Likelihood ratio: ↑ small)
- **Inspections at unaffected sites:** A minor positive signal, but it avoids the core issue. (Likelihood ratio: ↑ small)

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Starting with a prior probability of 20%, the overwhelming negative evidence (particularly the military strike and the scrapping of the deal) suggests a significant downward revision. The small positive signals are insufficient to counterbalance the strong negative indicators.

Using a conceptual Bayesian update:
- Prior odds = 0.20 / 0.80 = 0.25
- Likelihood ratio (net effect of evidence) is strongly negative, suggesting a downward adjustment by a factor of approximately 0.5.
- Posterior odds = 0.25 × 0.5 = 0.125
- Posterior probability = 0.125 / (1 + 0.125) ≈ 0.111 or 11.1%

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** The analysis might underestimate Iran's potential strategic shifts or internal political changes.
- **Alternative Scenario:** A sudden diplomatic breakthrough, perhaps mediated by a third party, could lead to a rapid agreement.
- **Rebuttals:** The current hardline stance and recent actions strongly suggest that such a breakthrough is unlikely in the short term.

### 6. Final Forecast
Considering the base rate, evidence, and potential alternative scenarios, the final calibrated probability is:

Final: 11%

# Will Iran allow the IAEA to inspect its stockpile of enriched uranium before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to identify an appropriate base rate for Iran allowing IAEA inspections of its enriched uranium stockpile following a major military strike on its nuclear facilities.

The most relevant reference class is "Post-Crisis Nuclear Negotiations with Iran," particularly focusing on Iran's willingness to make significant concessions on nuclear access within a short timeframe after a major crisis. Based on Iran's historical pattern of nuclear diplomacy:

- Iran typically engages in protracted brinkmanship, using access as a bargaining chip
- Quick resolutions (within 3 months) are rare
- The base rate for Iran making significant concessions within 3 months of a major crisis is approximately 15-25%

Given the unprecedented nature of direct US military strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, I should also consider the reference class of "Adversarial State Concessions After Direct Military Strikes," which suggests an even lower base rate of <10%.

**Prior probability: 15%** (This reflects the low historical likelihood of Iran making rapid concessions on nuclear inspections, especially after a direct military strike)

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Iran is under international pressure to allow inspections
- The IAEA is seeking access to verify nuclear materials
- Iran is using access as a bargaining chip in a broader geopolitical context

**Key differences that matter:**
- **Direct US military action**: Unlike previous crises driven by sanctions or covert sabotage, this follows an overt US military attack, making concessions appear as surrender to American military might
- **Physical destruction of facilities**: The inspections would be forensic accounting in debris fields, not monitoring of intact sites
- **High-value target**: The 400kg of 60% enriched uranium is near-weapon-grade material, raising the stakes
- **Extremely short time horizon**: Only ~40 days remain until the question resolves, while Iran-IAEA agreements typically take months or years to negotiate
- **Recent reversal**: Iran explicitly scrapped a previous inspection agreement on October 20, 2025

These differences, particularly the direct US military strike and the recent reversal of a prior agreement, significantly reduce the likelihood compared to the base rate.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Iran's parliament voted to suspend IAEA cooperation (June 25, 2025)**
- P(E|H): If Iran will allow inspections, this vote would be a temporary posturing measure (~70%)
- P(E|~H): If Iran won't allow inspections, this vote would be expected (~95%)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.74
- This evidence moderately decreases the probability

**Evidence 2: Iran and IAEA announced a deal to resume inspections (September 9, 2025)**
- P(E|H): If Iran will allow inspections, this announcement would be very likely (~90%)
- P(E|~H): If Iran won't allow inspections, this announcement could be a temporary diplomatic maneuver (~30%)
- Likelihood ratio: 3.0
- This evidence increases the probability

**Evidence 3: Iran declared the September deal void (October 20, 2025)**
- P(E|H): If Iran will allow inspections, voiding a previous deal is unlikely (~20%)
- P(E|~H): If Iran won't allow inspections, voiding the deal is very likely (~90%)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.22
- This evidence significantly decreases the probability

**Evidence 4: IAEA confirms inspectors returned to unaffected Iranian sites (November 19, 2025)**
- P(E|H): If Iran will allow inspections at bombed sites, allowing access to unaffected sites is very likely (~95%)
- P(E|~H): If Iran won't allow inspections at bombed sites, they might still allow access to unaffected sites as a minimal concession (~60%)
- Likelihood ratio: 1.58
- This evidence slightly increases the probability

**Evidence 5: Iran is demanding guarantees of enrichment rights as a precondition (November 20, 2025)**
- P(E|H): If Iran will allow inspections, setting such preconditions is somewhat likely (~50%)
- P(E|~H): If Iran won't allow inspections, setting unacceptable preconditions is very likely (~90%)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.56
- This evidence moderately decreases the probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior of 15% (odds of 0.176), I'll update based on the most significant evidence:

**Update on Evidence 3 (Iran voiding the September deal):**
- Prior odds: 0.176
- Likelihood ratio: 0.22
- Posterior odds: 0.176 × 0.22 = 0.039
- Posterior probability: 0.039 / (1 + 0.039) = 3.8%

This is a significant decrease from the prior, reflecting the strong signal sent by Iran's explicit rejection of the inspection agreement.

**Update on Evidence 5 (Iran's preconditions):**
- Prior odds (from previous update): 0.039
- Likelihood ratio: 0.56
- Posterior odds: 0.039 × 0.56 = 0.022
- Posterior probability: 0.022 / (1 + 0.022) = 2.2%

The posterior probability after these updates is approximately 2.2%, reflecting the combined impact of Iran's actions that strongly signal unwillingness to allow inspections.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating Iran's fear of further military strikes, which could motivate compliance
- Secret back-channel negotiations might be occurring that could lead to a surprise agreement
- Economic pressure might be more severe than publicly known, increasing incentives for cooperation
- The regime might calculate that a limited inspection agreement could relieve pressure while revealing little

**Alternative scenarios:**
- Iran could announce a highly conditional agreement just before the deadline that technically qualifies as "allowing inspections" but contains provisions that make actual access unlikely
- A domestic political shift could occur if moderates gain influence due to economic pressures
- Iran might agree to inspections of only a portion of the sites as a compromise

**Best alternative forecast:**
The best case for a higher probability would be that Iran fears additional strikes and calculates that a limited inspection agreement would prevent further military action while buying time. This could justify a probability of perhaps 10-15%.

**Rebuttal to alternative:**
The recent evidence strongly suggests hardliners are in control of Iran's nuclear policy. The regime has explicitly rejected the previous agreement and set preconditions it knows are unacceptable. The extremely short timeframe (40 days) makes a diplomatic breakthrough highly unlikely given Iran's historical pace of negotiations.

After considering these alternative perspectives, I believe my forecast may be slightly too low. I'll adjust upward slightly to account for the possibility of last-minute diplomatic breakthroughs or fear-driven concessions.

## 6. Final Forecast

After considering the base rate, the specific context of direct US military strikes, the recent explicit rejection of the inspection agreement, and Iran's setting of unacceptable preconditions, I assess there is a very low probability that Iran will allow IAEA inspections of its enriched uranium stockpile before 2026.

The timeframe is extremely short (40 days), and Iran has strong political incentives to maintain its defiant stance following a direct US military attack. The most recent evidence points strongly toward continued refusal.

Final: 4%

Here is a probabilistic forecast based on the provided information.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most appropriate reference class is "adversarial state concessions after direct military strikes." Historically, states subjected to overt military attacks by a major power tend to adopt a defiant posture in the immediate aftermath to project strength and maintain domestic legitimacy (the "rally 'round the flag" effect). Making significant concessions within a short timeframe (<3 months) is rare. The base rate for such a concession is very low, likely below 10%. Given the extremely short timeframe for this question (approximately 40 days), an initial prior probability P(H) of **5%** is appropriate. This reflects the inherent unlikelihood of a rapid diplomatic reversal following a significant military humiliation.

Prior Odds: 5% probability corresponds to 1:19 odds (5 to 95).

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation is more extreme than a typical base case of post-strike negotiations, making a concession even less likely.
*   **Similarity:** The event involves an adversarial state (Iran) under intense international pressure regarding its nuclear program, a recurring pattern.
*   **Differences:**
    *   **Direct US Strike:** This crisis was triggered by a direct, overt US military strike on Iranian sovereign territory, not by sanctions or covert action. This dramatically increases the political cost for the Iranian regime to make any concession, as it would be perceived as direct capitulation to military force.
    *   **Physical Destruction:** The facilities in question are destroyed. This provides Iran with a powerful and technically plausible reason to delay inspections indefinitely, claiming the sites are unsafe or that accounting for nuclear material in the rubble is impossible.
    *   **Short Timeframe:** The 40-day window is exceptionally short for the typically slow and complex nature of nuclear diplomacy with Iran.

These differences all suggest the probability should be even lower than the already low base rate.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
We can evaluate key events since the June 2025 strikes as evidence to update our prior.

*   **Evidence 1: Iran announces the September 9th inspection deal is void (October 20).**
    *   This is the most significant piece of evidence. It is a direct reversal of a previous positive step.
    *   P(E | H: Iran will agree by Dec 31): Very low. A state intending to make a deal shortly would not publicly and decisively scrap a recent, similar agreement.
    *   P(E | ~H: Iran will not agree): High. This action is highly consistent with a decision by hardline factions to cease cooperation and resist pressure.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio (P(E|H)/P(E|~H)) << 1.** This evidence strongly decreases the probability.

*   **Evidence 2: Iran sets preconditions for talks, demanding its "right to enrich" be guaranteed (November 20).**
    *   This is a classic diplomatic delaying tactic.
    *   P(E | H): Low. Setting preconditions known to be unacceptable to the other side is not a sign of good-faith negotiation for a near-term agreement.
    *   P(E | ~H): High. This is a standard move for a party that wants to appear open to talks while ensuring they go nowhere.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio << 1.** This evidence also decreases the probability.

*   **Evidence 3: IAEA inspectors return to *unaffected* Iranian nuclear sites (November 19).**
    *   This is a minor concession.
    *   P(E | H): Moderately high. This could be a small confidence-building measure on the path to a larger deal.
    *   P(E | ~H): Moderate. This could also be a tactic to relieve minor pressure and create a facade of cooperation while stonewalling on the core issue.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio ≈ 1.** This evidence is weak and has a negligible net effect on the probability.

The overall weight of recent, specific evidence is strongly negative.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
We start with a prior of 5% (1:19 odds). The most crucial piece of evidence is Iran scrapping the September deal. This indicates that whatever pragmatic forces allowed that deal to be made have been overruled. This is a powerful signal of intent.

*   **Prior Odds:** 1:19
*   **Likelihood Ratio (Composite of recent evidence):** The evidence (scrapping the deal, setting preconditions) is much more likely if Iran does *not* plan to agree to inspections than if it does. A conservative composite likelihood ratio would be around 1/3.
*   **Posterior Odds ≈** Prior Odds × Likelihood Ratio = (1/19) × (1/3) = 1/57
*   **Posterior Probability ≈** 1 / (1 + 57) = 1/58 ≈ 1.7%

This mechanical update suggests a very low probability. Qualitatively, the path to a "Yes" has been actively closed off by Iran's recent actions.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
The strongest argument for a "Yes" outcome is that Iran could announce a purely symbolic or procedural agreement to avert further military or economic pressure, without any intention of immediate implementation. The resolution criteria hinge on an "announcement of an agreement," which could be a flimsy "agreement to begin talks on a roadmap for future inspections." This is a known tactic in Iran's diplomatic playbook. This possibility of a face-saving, non-substantive announcement means the probability is not near zero.

However, the recent evidence, especially the public cancellation of the September deal, suggests that the current political climate in Tehran is hostile to even symbolic concessions. The hardline faction appears dominant and may prefer continued defiance over tactical diplomacy.

Therefore, while the "symbolic deal" scenario is the most plausible path to a "Yes," its likelihood is still low given the political dynamics. I will adjust my posterior probability upward from the mechanically derived ~2% to account for this possibility, but only slightly.

### 6. Final Forecast
The base rate for a country making such a concession after a direct military strike is extremely low. The specific evidence from the past two months, particularly Iran's decision to void a previous inspection deal, strongly reinforces a negative forecast. The political cost of being seen to capitulate appears too high for the Iranian regime in this short timeframe. The only plausible path to a "Yes" is a purely symbolic announcement to buy time, but even this seems unlikely given the current hardline posture.

Final: 5%
