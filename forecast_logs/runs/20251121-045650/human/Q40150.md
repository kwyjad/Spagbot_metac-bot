Here is my research plan.

### **Step 1: Identify Core Research Questions**

1.  **Reference Class Analysis:** What are the historical precedents for the U.S. launching military attacks, particularly unilateral and/or punitive ones, in sovereign nations where it is not already engaged in open conflict? What is the base rate for such actions?
2.  **Actor Analysis (President Trump):** What is the established pattern of President Trump's foreign policy decision-making regarding the use of military force? Specifically, how does he weigh public threats, personal credibility, military advice, and domestic political considerations?
3.  **Scenario-Specific Drivers:** What are the unique elements of this Nigeria scenario? This includes the "protection of Christians" rationale, the specific nature of the public threats, and the very short time horizon.
4.  **Constraints and Countervailing Forces:** What factors would inhibit such an attack? This includes potential pushback from the Pentagon and State Department, the strategic importance of Nigeria, international condemnation, and the risk of escalation or mission creep.
5.  **Operational Feasibility:** What are the practical capabilities of the U.S. military (specifically AFRICOM) to conduct a limited strike in Nigeria on short notice? What would be the likely form of such an attack (e.g., drone strike, special forces raid)?
6.  **Leading Indicators:** What observable signals in the immediate future (next 1-4 weeks) would indicate a higher or lower probability of an attack?

### **Step 3: Synthesize Key Findings**

*   **Base Rate:** Unilateral U.S. strikes on a new country are rare but not unprecedented. The most relevant reference class is not broad interventions, but limited, punitive strikes in response to a specific transgression (e.g., Syria 2017 chemical attack, Libya 1986 bombing). These are low-probability events but occur when a President perceives a "red line" has been crossed. Nigeria's status as a major regional power and partner makes this an even rarer event type.
*   **Trump's Pattern:** President Trump has shown a willingness to use limited, decisive force (Syria 2017, Soleimani 2020) especially when he feels U.S. credibility is on the line or a clear message must be sent. His decision-making is highly personalized and often driven by television coverage and advice from a close circle, sometimes bypassing institutional processes. The public, personal nature of the threat in the prompt is a key factor, as it directly engages his personal credibility.
*   **Scenario Specifics:** The "protecting Christians" rationale is a powerful motivator for a key segment of Trump's political base. The very public and specific nature of the threat ("guns-a-blazing") creates a commitment trap; backing down could be framed as weakness. The short timeline (before 2026) means any action must be imminent and likely based on pre-existing plans.
*   **Constraints:** The Pentagon and State Department would likely advise extreme caution, highlighting Nigeria's role as a key regional anchor, the risk of destabilizing a country of 200+ million people, and the potential for alienating the entire African continent. An attack would shatter counter-terrorism cooperation. Nigeria is not a pariah state like Syria or 1980s Libya.
*   **Feasibility:** The U.S. possesses the technical capability to conduct a strike. AFRICOM has assets (drones, special forces, naval assets) that could be brought to bear. The most likely form would be a drone strike or a cruise missile attack on a known terrorist training camp, presented as a "counter-terror" operation to provide a veneer of justification.
*   **Conclusion:** The base rate is very low. However, the specific actor (Trump) and the public commitment he has made in this fictional scenario dramatically increase the probability. The central tension is between Trump's personalistic, credibility-focused decision-making and the immense strategic and institutional constraints against attacking a major partner like Nigeria.

### **Step 4: Draft the Comprehensive Answer**

---

### Reference class & base rates
*   **Limited Punitive Strikes on Sovereign Nations:** The most relevant class is U.S. unilateral, limited military strikes intended to punish or send a message, conducted without host-nation consent. Examples include strikes on Libya (1986), Sudan/Afghanistan (1998), and Syria (2017). The base rate for such an event against *any* given country in a given year is very low, likely **<1%**.
*   **New U.S. Military Interventions in Africa:** The U.S. has conducted operations in Africa (e.g., Somalia, Libya, Niger), but these are typically in failed/failing states or with some level of partner government consent (even if tacit). Initiating a new, non-consensual attack on a major, stable regional power like Nigeria is virtually unprecedented in the post-Cold War era. The base rate here is near **0%**.
*   **Limitations:** These base rates are based on past presidential behavior and geopolitical norms. The current scenario involves a specific, public threat from a President known for disrupting those norms, suggesting the base rate may be a less reliable guide than usual.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   [2025-11-01] Trump orders DoD to ‘prepare for possible action’ in Nigeria. — ↑ (Moderate) — Moves the issue from rhetoric to the military planning process, a necessary precondition for action.
*   [2025-11-early] Trump posts on Truth Social threatening to go in “guns-a-blazing.” — ↑↑ (Large) — This creates a public, personal commitment trap. Backing down now carries a political cost for the President, making action more likely to save face and project strength to his base.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **Presidential Credibility & Psychology (Trump):** The President has publicly tied his credibility to this issue. A perception that Nigeria is ignoring his warning could trigger a punitive response. This is the single most important driver. (Large)
*   **Domestic Political Calculus:** An attack could serve as a "rally 'round the flag" event and strongly appeal to his evangelical base, for whom the persecution of Christians is a salient issue. (Moderate)
*   **Availability of a "Justifiable" Target:** The feasibility of an attack hinges on intelligence identifying a target (e.g., an ISWAP or Boko Haram camp) that can be struck with minimal collateral damage and plausibly framed as a counter-terror operation. (Moderate)
*   **Institutional Restraint (DoD/State Dept.):** Strong opposition from the national security bureaucracy, citing the immense diplomatic blowback and risk to long-term strategic interests (e.g., regional stability, China's influence), could delay or moderate plans. (Moderate)
*   **Nigerian De-escalation:** The Nigerian government could take highly visible action against extremist groups and publicly credit the U.S. President's pressure, providing him with a political "win" without the need for military action. (Moderate)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **The Target Nation:** Unlike typical targets of unilateral strikes (e.g., Syria, Sudan, Libya at the time), Nigeria is a major regional power, a democracy (albeit flawed), and a key U.S. counter-terrorism partner. Attacking it is a far greater diplomatic risk.
*   **The Public Threat:** The threat was not delivered through private diplomatic channels but via public statements and social media. This makes it a test of the President's personal resolve rather than a standard policy dispute.
*   **The Rationale:** The explicit rationale of "protecting Christians" is primarily a domestic political appeal, differing from more traditional justifications like WMDs (Syria), terrorism (Sudan/Afghanistan), or direct attacks on U.S. personnel (Libya).
*   **The Actor:** President Trump's decision-making style is known to be less constrained by institutional norms and more influenced by personal relationships, media coverage, and perceptions of strength and weakness.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A very low prior is warranted, perhaps 1-2%, reflecting the near-zero base rate of the U.S. attacking a major, non-hostile partner. (Equivalent n: ~50-100).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   ↑ (Moderate) DoD ordered to "prepare": This makes the improbable plausible, moving the probability out of

To forecast the probability of the United States conducting a military attack within Nigeria before 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Base Rate for U.S. Unilateral Military Strikes:** Historically, the U.S. has conducted unilateral military strikes in response to specific provocations or threats, such as the 1986 Libya bombing, 1998 Sudan/Afghanistan strikes, and 2017 Syria airstrikes. These events are rare, especially against countries that are not in open conflict with the U.S. or are not considered pariah states. The base rate for such actions is low, likely less than 1% per year for any given country.
- **Base Rate for New Military Interventions in Africa:** The U.S. has engaged in military operations in Africa, but these are typically in failed states or with some level of consent. A new, non-consensual attack on a stable, major regional power like Nigeria is unprecedented, suggesting a base rate near 0%.
- **Chosen Prior:** Given the rarity and the specific context of Nigeria, a prior probability of 1% is reasonable.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** The situation involves a public threat from a U.S. President, similar to past instances where the U.S. has used military force following public statements.
- **Differences:** Nigeria is a significant regional power and a U.S. partner, unlike typical targets of unilateral strikes. The public nature of the threat and the specific rationale of protecting Christians are unique factors.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **DoD Ordered to Prepare:** This indicates a serious consideration of military action, increasing the likelihood compared to the base rate. (Likelihood ratio > 1)
- **Public Threat on Social Media:** The public nature of the threat increases the probability due to the President's credibility being on the line. (Likelihood ratio > 1)
- **Constraints from DoD/State Dept.:** Strong institutional resistance and the strategic importance of Nigeria decrease the likelihood. (Likelihood ratio < 1)
- **Feasibility of a Justifiable Target:** The availability of a target that can be framed as a counter-terror operation increases the likelihood. (Likelihood ratio > 1)

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
- **Prior Odds:** 1% probability translates to odds of 1:99.
- **Likelihood Ratio:** Considering the evidence, a moderate increase in likelihood is warranted. Let's assume a likelihood ratio of 3, reflecting the increased probability due to the President's public commitment and the DoD's preparation.
- **Posterior Odds:** 1:99 × 3 = 3:99, or approximately 1:33.
- **Posterior Probability:** 1 / (1 + 33) ≈ 2.94%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** The forecast should account for the unpredictability of Trump's decision-making and the potential for diplomatic resolutions.
- **Alternative Scenarios:** Nigeria could take actions to de-escalate tensions, or internal U.S. opposition could prevent an attack.
- **Adjustment:** Given these considerations, a slight downward adjustment is prudent to account for diplomatic and institutional constraints.

### 6. Final Forecast
- **Final Probability:** Considering all factors, the probability of the U.S. conducting a military attack within Nigeria before 2026 is approximately 2.5%.

Final: 2.5%

# Will the United States conduct a military attack within Nigeria before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to identify an appropriate base rate for the US conducting a military attack within a sovereign nation like Nigeria.

The most relevant reference class is US unilateral military strikes against sovereign nations where:
- The US is not already in open conflict
- The strikes are conducted without host nation consent
- The target is a significant regional power (not a failed state)

Historical examples include:
- Libya (1986) - Operation El Dorado Canyon
- Sudan/Afghanistan (1998) - Operation Infinite Reach
- Syria (2017) - Shayrat airbase strike

These events are rare. The US has conducted such strikes against perhaps 5-7 countries over the past 40 years, giving a rough base rate of 0.125-0.175 strikes per year against any country. For a specific country like Nigeria, the prior would be much lower.

Given Nigeria's status as a major regional partner and the short timeframe (approximately 1 month remaining in 2025), I'll set a conservative prior of **2%**.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- The US has military capabilities to conduct such an attack (AFRICOM presence)
- There are terrorist/extremist groups operating in Nigeria that could serve as targets
- The US has previously conducted limited strikes against terrorist targets globally

**Key differences:**
- Nigeria is a key US partner in counterterrorism, unlike typical targets of unilateral strikes
- Nigeria is Africa's largest economy and most populous nation, making intervention riskier
- The stated motivation (protecting Christians) differs from typical national security justifications
- The extremely public nature of Trump's threat creates a unique commitment dynamic
- The very short timeframe (about 1 month) limits planning options

These differences significantly alter the probability, with some factors increasing it (public commitment) and others decreasing it (strategic partnership).

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Trump's public threat on Truth Social**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.9) - If Trump were planning to attack, making a public threat aligns with his pattern of telegraphing intentions
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.3) - Trump has made threats without follow-through before (e.g., "fire and fury" with North Korea)
- Likelihood ratio: ~3.0
- This evidence increases probability significantly

**Evidence 2: Trump ordering DoD to "prepare for possible action"**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.95) - Military preparation is a necessary precursor to action
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.4) - Presidents often order contingency planning without execution
- Likelihood ratio: ~2.4
- This evidence increases probability moderately

**Evidence 3: The specific "protection of Christians" framing**
- P(E|H): High (~0.8) - This framing appeals to Trump's evangelical base, providing political benefit
- P(E|~H): Moderate-high (~0.6) - This framing could be used for political signaling without action
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.3
- This evidence increases probability slightly

**Evidence 4: Nigeria's status as a major US partner**
- P(E|H): Low (~0.2) - Attacking a partner carries significant diplomatic costs
- P(E|~H): High (~0.8) - The US typically avoids attacking strategic partners
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.25
- This evidence decreases probability significantly

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 2:98 (2% probability):

**Update on Trump's public threat:**
- Prior odds: 2:98 = 0.0204
- Likelihood ratio: 3.0
- Posterior odds: 0.0204 × 3.0 = 0.0612
- Posterior probability: 0.0612/(1+0.0612) ≈ 5.8%

**Update on DoD preparation order:**
- Prior odds: 0.0612
- Likelihood ratio: 2.4
- Posterior odds: 0.0612 × 2.4 = 0.1469
- Posterior probability: 0.1469/(1+0.1469) ≈ 12.8%

**Update on "protection of Christians" framing:**
- Prior odds: 0.1469
- Likelihood ratio: 1.3
- Posterior odds: 0.1469 × 1.3 = 0.191
- Posterior probability: 0.191/(1+0.191) ≈ 16%

**Update on Nigeria's status as major US partner:**
- Prior odds: 0.191
- Likelihood ratio: 0.25
- Posterior odds: 0.191 × 0.25 = 0.048
- Posterior probability: 0.048/(1+0.048) ≈ 4.6%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating Trump's willingness to follow through on public threats to maintain credibility
- I may be overestimating institutional constraints within the Pentagon
- The short timeframe (about 1 month) may make action less likely than I've estimated
- I haven't fully accounted for potential Nigerian government responses that could defuse the situation

**Alternative scenarios:**
- Trump could order a very limited drone strike against a clear terrorist target, framing it as counterterrorism rather than intervention
- The Nigerian government might take visible action against extremists, giving Trump a "win" without US military action
- Trump might extend his threat but delay action into early 2026

**Adjustments:**
Given the extremely short timeframe (only about a month left in 2025) and the significant diplomatic complications, I should adjust my probability downward slightly. However, Trump's personal commitment and the political benefits of appearing strong on protecting Christians create countervailing pressure.

## 6. Final Forecast

After considering all evidence and potential blind spots, I believe there is approximately a 5% chance that the US will conduct a military attack within Nigeria before 2026. This reflects the very low base rate, adjusted upward by Trump's public commitment and preparation orders, but constrained by the strategic partnership with Nigeria and the very short timeframe remaining.

Final: 5%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The event in question is a unilateral U.S. military attack on a sovereign nation with which it is not in open conflict, but is considered a partner. This is an extremely rare event. The most relevant reference class includes limited, punitive strikes like those against Libya (1986), Sudan/Afghanistan (1998), and Syria (2017/2018). However, all those nations were considered adversaries or pariah states at the time of the attacks. Nigeria is a major regional power, a democracy, and a key U.S. counter-terrorism partner.

An attack on a partner nation is virtually unprecedented. The 2011 raid in Abbottabad, Pakistan, is a possible analogue, but it was a covert special forces operation targeting an exceptionally high-value individual (Osama bin Laden), not a punitive strike meant to coerce a government. Given the extreme rarity of an overt, non-consensual attack on a major partner, a very low base rate is appropriate. I will set the prior probability P(H) at **2%**. This is low, but slightly higher than a near-zero estimate to account for the general instability in the Sahel region which makes it a plausible focus of U.S. military attention.

Prior Odds: 2 / 98 ≈ 1:49.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
*   **Similarities**: The U.S. possesses the military capability for a limited strike (drones, cruise missiles). There are identifiable targets (terrorist camps) that could provide a public justification for a "counter-terror" operation. The situation involves a U.S. president considering military action to send a strong message.
*   **Differences**:
    *   **The Target Nation**: Unlike past targets (Syria, Libya), Nigeria is a major, democratic partner. Attacking it would carry immense diplomatic and strategic costs, potentially destabilizing a nation of over 200 million people and undermining years of counter-terrorism cooperation. This makes an attack far less likely than in the base cases.
    *   **The Actor**: President Trump's decision-making style is a critical variable. He is known to be less constrained by institutional advice (from the Pentagon or State Department) and more motivated by personal credibility, media narratives, and his political base. This personality factor significantly increases the probability compared to a generic U.S. president.
    *   **The Rationale & Threat**: The explicit rationale of "protecting Christians" has strong domestic political appeal to Trump's base. Crucially, the threat was made publicly and personally via Truth Social. This creates a "commitment trap": backing down after such a direct threat could be perceived as weakness, making follow-through more likely to save face.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
Two key pieces of evidence must be evaluated:

*   **Evidence 1 (E1)**: Trump has "ordered the DoD to ‘prepare for possible action’ in Nigeria."
    *   **P(E1 | H)**: If the U.S. were to attack (H), an order to prepare plans is a necessary precondition. This probability is very high, P(E1 | H) ≈ 0.95.
    *   **P(E1 | ~H)**: If the U.S. were not going to attack (~H), a president might still order planning as a diplomatic threat, to explore options, or to project strength, before ultimately deciding against it. For President Trump, this is a plausible tactic. Let's estimate P(E1 | ~H) ≈ 0.25.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio (LR1)**: 0.95 / 0.25 = 3.8. This evidence moderately increases the probability of an attack.

*   **Evidence 2 (E2)**: Trump's public "guns-a-blazing" threat on Truth Social.
    *   **P(E2 | H)**: If Trump intends to attack (H), making a public threat to justify the action, rally his base, and frame the narrative is highly characteristic of his style. P(E2 | H) is high, perhaps 0.8.
    *   **P(E2 | ~H)**: If Trump does not intend to attack (~H), he might still make such a threat for its domestic political effect and to intimidate the Nigerian government. He has a history of bombastic rhetoric ("fire and fury") that does not lead to action. However, this threat is very specific and creates a strong commitment trap. Let's estimate P(E2 | ~H) ≈ 0.20.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio (LR2)**: 0.8 / 0.20 = 4. This evidence also strongly increases the probability.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Let's update the prior odds using the evidence.

*   **Prior Odds**: 1:49 (2% probability).
*   **Update with E1 (DoD planning)**:
    *   Posterior Odds = Prior Odds × LR1 = (1:49) × 3.8 ≈ 3.8:49.
*   **Update with E2 (Public Threat)**:
    *   Posterior Odds = (3.8:49) × LR2 = (3.8:49) × 4 ≈ 15.2:49.
*   **Final Posterior Probability**:
    *   Probability = Odds / (1 + Odds) = 15.2 / (15.2 + 49) = 15.2 / 64.2 ≈ 23.7%.

The calculation suggests that the specific evidence has moved the probability from a very low base rate of 2% to a significant risk of around 24%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My analysis hinges on the tension between Trump's personalistic style and the immense strategic costs of such an attack.

*   **Argument for a Lower Probability (<24%)**: I may be underestimating the power of institutional constraints and the availability of a face-saving "off-ramp." The Nigerian government, faced with this threat, has a strong incentive to launch a highly-publicized crackdown on extremist groups and publicly credit Trump's pressure. This would give Trump a political victory he could tout to his base without firing a single shot, which is a very plausible and attractive alternative to a risky military strike. The national security apparatus would almost certainly advocate strongly for this de-escalatory path.

*   **Argument for a Higher Probability (>24%)**: I may be underestimating the power of the commitment trap I identified. The Soleimani strike in 2020 is a key precedent where Trump took decisive, high-risk military action against the advice of some advisors. If he perceives the Nigerian response as insufficient or feels his credibility is on the line, his personal psychology could easily override strategic logic. The attack itself could be a limited, symbolic drone or missile strike on an isolated target, making it militarily "easy" to execute, thus lowering the bar for action.

*   **Adjustment**: The off-ramp scenario is very compelling and is the most likely path to de-escalation. However, the "Soleimani risk" of an impulsive, credibility-driven strike is also very real. The 24% figure from the calculation feels like a solid median, but I will increase it slightly to better reflect the tail risk of Trump's unpredictable decision-making. A final probability in the high 20s seems to capture this balance of a likely off-ramp against a non-trivial risk of impulsive action.

### 6. Final Forecast
The base rate for a U.S. attack on a major partner like Nigeria is extremely low. However, the specific actor, President Trump, and his public, personal threats dramatically increase the probability. His actions create a commitment trap where he may feel compelled to act to maintain his image of strength. While institutional constraints and the potential for a diplomatic off-ramp make an attack unlikely on balance, the president's known tendency for unpredictable, norm-breaking decisions creates a substantial risk. The evidence moves the probability from nearly impossible to a very plausible risk.

Final: 28%
