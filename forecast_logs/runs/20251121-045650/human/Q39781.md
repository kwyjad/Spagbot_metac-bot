### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Ecuadorian States of Emergency (General):** Since 2019, Ecuador has frequently used states of emergency to manage crises, including gang violence, prison riots, social unrest, and the COVID-19 pandemic. These are typically declared for 30 or 60 days. The constitution permits one 30-day renewal. They are a common but temporary tool. A random day in the last 5 years might have a 15-25% chance of having at least one province under a state of emergency. However, the base rate for a *specific* state of emergency lasting beyond its initial 60-day term is lower, as they often de-escalate or are legally constrained.
2.  **States of Emergency for Indigenous-led Protests:** Major protests led by indigenous groups (primarily CONAIE) against economic measures occurred in 2019 and 2022. In both cases, states of emergency were declared but were lifted after 1-3 weeks following negotiations and agreements. This class suggests that protest-related emergencies are intense but relatively short-lived, designed to create leverage for negotiation rather than to be sustained indefinitely.
3.  **President Noboa's States of Emergency:** Noboa's presidency began with a nationwide state of emergency in January 2024 to combat gang violence. This was popular and framed as a security necessity. This suggests a willingness to use the tool broadly, but the current crisis is driven by social protest, not organized crime, making the political calculus different.

**Conclusion:** The base rates suggest states of emergency are temporary. The current 60-day declaration from October 4 is scheduled to expire around December 3, 2025, *before* the resolution date. The default outcome is therefore 0. The key question is the probability of an extension or a new declaration.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-10-04** Declaration of 60-day state of emergency in 10 provinces due to protests over diesel subsidy cuts. — ↑ — Establishes the initial condition and the 60-day clock.
*   **2025-10-06** State of emergency expanded to 16 provinces. — ↑ — Shows the government's escalating and broad response to the growing protests.
*   **2025-10-15 (projected)** Government and CONAIE leaders agree to preliminary talks, but maintain hardline public stances. — ↔ — A standard step in these conflicts, but rhetoric suggests talks may not be fruitful, maintaining tension.
*   **2025-11-05 (projected)** Constitutional Court issues a ruling, potentially limiting the scope of the emergency decree (e.g., on freedom of assembly) but upholding its core security provisions. — ↓ — Reaffirms a key check on executive power, making an indefinite or unjustified extension more difficult.
*   **2025-11-20 (projected)** As the December 3 expiry date nears, protests flare up in key cities, and negotiations are publicly declared "stalled." — ↑ — Increases the likelihood the government will seek an extension to maintain order and pressure negotiators.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Negotiation Outcome:** The progress of talks between the government and indigenous leaders (CONAIE) is the primary driver. A successful agreement would lead to the state of emergency expiring (large ↓). A complete breakdown would almost certainly trigger an extension (large ↑).
2.  **Level of Violence:** A significant escalation in violence—such as protester or security force deaths, or major infrastructure sabotage—would provide the government with strong justification for an extension (large ↑). A period of calm would make an extension appear disproportionate (large ↓).
3.  **Noboa's Political Calculus:** Noboa's administration may believe a hardline stance is popular with its base and projects strength. If polling supports this, they may extend the measure. Conversely, if the economic disruption and political friction erode his support, he will be incentivized to let it expire (moderate ↑/↓).
4.  **Constitutional Court Rulings:** The Ecuadorian Constitutional Court actively reviews and can limit or strike down states of emergency. A ruling that an extension is unjustified would be a powerful, legally binding constraint on the government (large ↓).
5.  **Holiday Season Security:** The government could use the pretext of ensuring security during the high-traffic Christmas season to extend the state of emergency in a limited number of commercially or logistically important provinces (small ↑).

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Aggressive "Narco-Terrorist" Framing:** Unlike past governments that treated protests as a social/political issue, Noboa has explicitly linked protesters to a foreign cartel (Tren de Aragua) and threatened terrorism charges. This raises the stakes, hardens positions, and makes a negotiated off-ramp more difficult.
*   **Noboa's Strong Security Mandate:** Noboa's political capital is heavily based on his successful security crackdown on gangs in early 2024. He may feel more politically insulated than his predecessors (Moreno, Lasso) to withstand a prolonged confrontation with CONAIE.
*   **Intractable Fiscal Issue:** The diesel subsidy cuts are not a minor policy tweak; they are central to the government's fiscal consolidation plan, likely under pressure from international lenders. This gives the government less flexibility to concede the central demand of the protesters compared to past disputes.
*   **Proximity to Expiration:** The resolution date (Dec 25) is just three weeks after the scheduled expiration (Dec 3). This makes the forecast highly sensitive to the specific events and decisions made in late November and early December, rather than a long-term trend.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** The prior should be strongly anchored at 0 provinces, reflecting the base rate that states of emergency are temporary and the current one is scheduled to expire before the resolution date. Equivalent n: ~10 (representing past crises that resolved within their initial term).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↓ Large) The legal framework and historical precedent strongly suggest the 60-day declaration will expire on schedule around Dec 3, before the resolution date.
    *   (↑ Large) Noboa's unprecedentedly aggressive rhetoric framing protesters as "narco-terrorists" makes a simple de-escalation and expiration less likely. It creates a political need for the government to not "lose" to the protesters.
    *   (↑ Moderate) The underlying fiscal necessity of the subsidy cuts makes the core issue less negotiable than in past protests, suggesting a prolonged conflict.
    *   (↓ Moderate) The Constitutional Court serves as a significant check on the executive's ability to arbitrarily extend the state of emergency without new, compelling justification.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly pulls in opposing directions. The prior of 0 remains the most likely single outcome (the mode). However, the significant countervailing evidence (Noboa's hardline stance, intractable issue) should substantially increase the probability mass on non-zero outcomes. The posterior should shift from a near-certainty of 0 to a bimodal or heavily skewed distribution with a peak at 0 and significant probability assigned to a renewal in a similar number of provinces (e.g., 10-16).

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Public statements from the Minister of Government or President Noboa about the "continuing threat" or the need to "guarantee security" through December.
    *   Arrest of high-profile indigenous leaders like Leonidas Iza.
    *   A formal, public breakdown of negotiation talks.
    *   Renewed, large-scale violent clashes or significant roadblocks in the week before December 3.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Announcement of a "technical working group" or joint commission between the government and CONAIE.
    *   A preliminary agreement on a compensation mechanism for affected sectors or a phased subsidy removal.
    *   A strong statement from the Constitutional Court questioning the justification for the current emergency.

To forecast the number of provinces in Ecuador that will be in a state of emergency on December 25, 2025, we will follow a Bayesian approach, incorporating the base rate, current evidence, and potential future developments.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - **Base Rate:** The historical use of states of emergency in Ecuador, particularly for social unrest, suggests they are temporary and often resolved within the initial declaration period. The base rate for a specific state of emergency lasting beyond its initial 60-day term is low.
   - **Mean/Median and Variance:** The mean is close to 0 provinces, given the typical resolution within the initial term. Variance is low, reflecting the temporary nature of these measures.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - **Similarity:** The current situation is similar to past instances where states of emergency were declared for social unrest and resolved within a short period.
   - **Difference:** The aggressive framing of the protests as linked to a foreign cartel and the intractable nature of the fiscal issue (diesel subsidy cuts) make this situation potentially more prolonged.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Aggressive Rhetoric:** Noboa's framing of the protests as linked to "narco-terrorists" increases the likelihood of a prolonged state of emergency (↑).
   - **Constitutional Court:** The court's potential intervention could limit the duration or scope of the emergency (↓).
   - **Negotiation Status:** Stalled negotiations and potential flare-ups in violence increase the likelihood of an extension (↑).
   - **Holiday Season Security:** The government might justify an extension for security during the holiday season (↑).

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - **Update Step:** Starting with a prior centered at 0, the evidence of aggressive rhetoric and stalled negotiations shifts the distribution towards higher values. However, the Constitutional Court's role and historical precedent pull it back towards 0.
   - **Posterior Shift:** The mean shifts slightly upward from 0, with increased variance to account for the possibility of an extension in several provinces.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - **Overconfidence Check:** The forecast should not overly rely on the assumption of a simple resolution. The aggressive rhetoric and fiscal constraints are significant factors.
   - **Tail Risks:** Consider the possibility of a major escalation or a breakthrough in negotiations, which could drastically change the situation.
   - **Alternative Forecast:** A plausible alternative is a partial extension affecting fewer provinces, focusing on key areas.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Given the evidence and potential developments, the forecast should reflect a bimodal distribution with a peak at 0 and significant probability for 10-16 provinces.

P10: 0  
P20: 0  
P40: 5  
P60: 10  
P80: 12  
P90: 16

# Forecast: How many provinces in Ecuador will be in a state of emergency on December 25, 2025?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll use multiple reference classes to establish a prior:

**Primary reference class**: States of emergency in Ecuador due to indigenous-led protests
- Historical pattern shows these typically last 1-3 weeks before negotiations lead to resolution
- The current 60-day declaration (Oct 4, 2025) would expire around Dec 3, 2025, before the resolution date
- Base rate suggests 0 provinces under emergency on Dec 25, 2025 is most likely

**Secondary reference class**: President Noboa's use of emergency powers
- Noboa has shown willingness to declare emergencies (nationwide in Jan 2024)
- Current emergency covers 16 of 24 provinces
- Base rate suggests if an emergency exists, it would likely cover multiple provinces

Prior distribution:
- Mode: 0 provinces (60-70% probability)
- If non-zero: likely 10-16 provinces (similar to current scope)
- Mean: ~3-4 provinces (weighted average of most likely 0 and less likely larger values)

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate**:
- Constitutional constraints still apply (60-day limit with one 30-day extension)
- Indigenous protests follow historical patterns of seeking negotiated outcomes
- Economic policy disputes typically resolve through compromise

**Key differences**:
- Noboa's unprecedented framing of protesters as "narco-terrorists" raises stakes
- The diesel subsidy cuts represent a core fiscal policy less amenable to compromise
- The Dec 25 resolution date falls just 3 weeks after scheduled expiration
- Holiday season security concerns could provide justification for extension

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence for higher values (non-zero provinces)**:
- Noboa's aggressive rhetoric linking protesters to Tren de Aragua cartel (strong ↑)
- Reported violence including injured soldiers and alleged assassination attempt (moderate ↑)
- Fiscal necessity of subsidy cuts makes compromise difficult (moderate ↑)
- Holiday security concerns could justify extension through Christmas (weak ↑)

**Evidence for lower values (zero provinces)**:
- Constitutional 60-day limit expires around Dec 3, before resolution date (strong ↓)
- Historical pattern shows protest-related emergencies typically resolve in 1-3 weeks (moderate ↓)
- Constitutional Court provides check on executive power (moderate ↓)
- Economic disruption creates pressure to resolve quickly (weak ↓)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior centered on 0 provinces (mode) with ~65% probability:

**First update - Constitutional timeline**:
- The 60-day emergency expires Dec 3, before resolution date
- This strongly favors 0 provinces (likelihood ratio ~3:1 favoring zero)
- Posterior shifts to ~80% probability of 0 provinces

**Second update - Noboa's hardline stance**:
- "Narco-terrorist" framing makes de-escalation harder
- Likelihood ratio ~1:2 against zero (favoring non-zero)
- Posterior shifts to ~65% probability of 0 provinces

**Third update - Negotiation dynamics**:
- Fiscal necessity makes compromise harder
- Likelihood ratio ~1:1.5 against zero
- Posterior shifts to ~55% probability of 0 provinces

Final posterior distribution:
- Mode: 0 provinces (~55%)
- Secondary mode: 10-16 provinces (~30%)
- Small probability of intermediate values (1-9 provinces) (~15%)

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots**:
- I may underestimate the government's willingness to extend emergencies through holiday season
- I might overestimate the effectiveness of constitutional constraints
- The situation could escalate dramatically in ways not captured by historical patterns

**Alternative scenarios**:
- New violence erupts just before Dec 3, providing justification for extension
- Partial extension: Government might extend emergency in only key provinces (5-8)
- Constitutional Court could strike down extension attempts entirely

**Adjustments needed**:
- Increase probability of intermediate values (partial extensions)
- Slightly widen confidence intervals to account for uncertainty
- Recognize bimodal nature of distribution (either 0 or multiple provinces)

## 6. Final Percentiles

P10: 0
P20: 0
P40: 0
P60: 5
P80: 14
P90: 18

Here is my probabilistic forecast.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The primary base rate is the history of states of emergency in Ecuador, particularly those declared in response to large-scale indigenous-led protests. Historically, such as in 2019 and 2022, these emergencies have been temporary tools to manage acute crises and create leverage for negotiations, typically being lifted within 1-3 weeks.

A broader base rate is the constitutional limit on states of emergency: they are declared for up to 60 days and can be renewed once for 30 days, subject to review by the Constitutional Court. The current 60-day state of emergency, declared on October 4, 2025, is scheduled to expire around December 3, 2025.

Given the resolution date of December 25, 2025, is three weeks *after* the scheduled expiration, the strong prior is that the number of provinces under this specific state of emergency will be **0**. The prior distribution is therefore heavily skewed, with a median and mode of 0, and a small probability of non-zero outcomes representing the chance of an extension or a new, overlapping crisis.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities:** The current situation follows the established pattern of protests against unpopular economic measures (subsidy cuts) leading to a state of emergency and calls for negotiation.

**Differences:**
1.  **Aggressive Government Rhetoric:** President Noboa's administration has framed the protests not as a social issue but as an act of "narco-terrorism," explicitly linking demonstrators to a foreign cartel. This hardline stance makes a negotiated de-escalation, typical in past events, more difficult and politically costly for the government.
2.  **Intractable Core Issue:** The diesel subsidy cuts are central to the government's fiscal policy, likely driven by external financial pressures. This gives the government less flexibility to compromise on the protesters' main demand compared to past disputes.
3.  **President's Political Standing:** Noboa's political capital is built on a popular "mano dura" (iron fist) security platform. He may feel more politically empowered to sustain a prolonged confrontation than his predecessors, who were often forced to negotiate from a weaker position.

These differences suggest the current crisis is less likely to follow the historical pattern of a quick resolution, increasing the probability of a protracted conflict that could lead to an extension of the state of emergency.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

*   **Evidence for Lower Values (closer to 0):**
    *   **Legal/Constitutional Constraints (Strong ↓):** The state of emergency legally expires before the resolution date. An extension requires new justification and is subject to review by the Constitutional Court, which acts as a significant check on executive power.
    *   **Historical Precedent (Moderate ↓):** Similar past crises have ended in negotiated settlements, with the state of emergency being a temporary measure.
    *   **Economic/Social Pressure (Moderate ↓):** Prolonged protests and security measures disrupt the economy, and the upcoming Christmas holiday season will amplify pressure on the government to restore normalcy.

*   **Evidence for Higher Values (>0):**
    *   **"Narco-Terrorist" Framing (Strong ↑):** This rhetoric raises the political stakes, making it difficult for the government to back down without appearing to "lose" to terrorists. This makes an extension to maintain a position of strength more likely.
    *   **Fiscal Intractability (Moderate ↑):** Since the underlying cause of the protests (subsidy cuts) is unlikely to be resolved by early December, the government will have a persistent justification for maintaining security measures.
    *   **Escalation of Violence (Moderate ↑):** The background notes kidnappings of soldiers and an alleged assassination attempt. Such events provide a powerful rationale for extending the state of emergency to "guarantee security."

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

My prior distribution is heavily concentrated at 0, with perhaps an 80% chance of expiration based on legal timelines and historical precedent.

The evidence, particularly Noboa's aggressive rhetoric and the intractable nature of the subsidy issue, acts as a strong likelihood update. This evidence is much more consistent with a scenario of prolonged conflict and extension than with the base case of a quick, negotiated resolution. This new information significantly increases the probability of a non-zero outcome.

Let's update the probability of a non-zero outcome from a prior of ~20% to a posterior of ~45%. This reflects a roughly even split between the powerful legal/historical pressures for expiration and the strong political/contextual pressures for extension.

The posterior distribution is now bimodal in spirit, with its largest mass (mode and median) at 0, but a substantial (~45%) probability of a non-zero outcome. If an extension occurs, it is likely to cover a significant number of provinces—either the core 10 protest regions or the full 16 currently affected—rather than just one or two.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My forecast's median is 0, which might seem low given the government's hardline stance. Could I be underestimating Noboa's willingness to push the legal boundaries for an extension? Yes. The "narco-terrorist" framing is a powerful tool that could be used to justify an extension to the public and the court. I have accounted for this by assigning a 45% probability to a non-zero outcome, which is a significant departure from the base rate.

Conversely, could I be underestimating the power of negotiation and economic pressure? The Christmas season is a powerful incentive for all parties to find a truce. A face-saving compromise (e.g., a phased subsidy removal with compensation) could be reached, leading to a clean expiration on Dec 3. This scenario supports the median of 0.

A tail risk is a massive escalation leading to a *nationwide* state of emergency (24 provinces). While unlikely, as the conflict is regional, it's a possibility. Another possibility is a partial extension in just a few key provinces (e.g., 2-5). My final distribution accounts for this by having a wide range in the upper percentiles, from a small number at P60 to a large number at P90, reflecting the uncertainty over the *scope* of a potential extension. The final percentiles reflect this uncertainty, with a median of 0 but a mean that is significantly higher.

### 6. Final Percentiles
