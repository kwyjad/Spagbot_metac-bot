### Reference class & base rates
-   **Challenger Social Network vs. Established Incumbent:** Historically, the success rate for a new social network directly challenging an established one with strong network effects (e.g., Facebook, Twitter) is very low. Failures like Google+, App.net, and Parler are more common than successes. The base rate of a challenger overtaking the incumbent within ~2.5 years is likely below 15%.
-   **New Product from a Mega-Platform with User Integration:** A more appropriate reference class is a new product launched by a tech giant (like Meta) that leverages an existing, massive user base. Examples include Instagram Stories (vs. Snapchat) and YouTube Shorts (vs. TikTok). In these cases, the success rate of capturing significant market share and user activity is much higher, perhaps in the 40-60% range, due to reduced friction for user acquisition and massive cross-promotion capabilities.
-   **Limitations:** This case is unique due to the perceived vulnerability and self-inflicted damage at the incumbent (X), which may inflate the base rate derived from the second reference class.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
-   [2025-09-16] Backlinko reports Threads reached 400M MAUs in Q3 2025. (↑) This is the most crucial and recent data point, placing Threads' user base in direct competition with historical estimates for X.
-   [2025-05-09] Resourcera reports Threads had over 320M MAUs as of January 2025. (↑) Demonstrates strong, sustained growth momentum through the first half of 2025.
-   [2024-12-16] Emarketer projects X will continue to lose millions of users through 2025, citing a drop in U.S. daily users. (↑) Suggests the target number for Threads to beat is shrinking, making the crossover more likely.
-   [2024-10-31] Meta's CEO announces Threads reached nearly 275M MAUs. (↑) Confirms the platform's explosive growth trajectory in the second half of 2024.
-   [2024-07-09] PCMag reports X's daily active user growth has stalled at ~251M. (↑) Stagnation at the incumbent is a strong positive signal for the challenger. This DAU figure suggests an MAU in the 350M-420M range, a very attainable target for Threads.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
-   **Instagram Integration (Large ↑):** This is the primary driver of Threads' success. By tying Threads accounts to Instagram, Meta created a frictionless onboarding process for a potential pool of over 2 billion users, solving the cold-start problem that kills most new social networks.
-   **Incumbent (X) Instability (Large ↑):** X's post-acquisition turmoil, including erratic policy changes, brand safety concerns for advertisers, and alienation of its core user base, has created a powerful push factor, driving users to seek alternatives.
-   **Network Effect Tipping Point (Moderate ↑/↓):** As more high-profile users, journalists, and communities migrate to Threads, its value as a public conversation platform increases, pulling in more users. This effect is self-reinforcing. The key uncertainty is whether X can retain enough critical communities to halt this migration.
-   **Feature Development & Parity (Moderate ↑):** Threads has been systematically closing the feature gap with X (e.g., improved search, trending topics, a robust web client). This reduces the switching costs for power users and makes Threads a more viable day-to-day replacement.
-   **Global Availability (Small ↑):** The launch in the EU in late 2023 provided a significant one-time user boost. While the main impact is already reflected in the numbers, continued global marketing and optimization can still contribute to growth.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
-   **Unprecedented User Acquisition Engine:** Unlike any historical challenger, Threads was able to leverage the Instagram social graph to achieve 100 million sign-ups in under a week. This is a structural advantage that no previous Twitter competitor has possessed.
-   **A Uniquely Vulnerable Incumbent:** Most established social networks are difficult to unseat because they are stable and growing. X, by contrast, is in a period of managed decline and brand damage, creating a rare window of opportunity for a challenger.
-   **Massive, Patient Capital:** Meta can operate Threads at a loss for years, focusing entirely on user growth rather than immediate monetization. This is a luxury unavailable to startup challengers.
-   **Clear Value Proposition:** Threads is not a niche alternative; it is a direct, mass-market replacement for the core functionality of Twitter/X, making the choice for disaffected users straightforward.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
-   **Prior:** Based on the "New Product from a Mega-Platform" reference class, a prior of ~50% seems appropriate, reflecting both the high potential and the inherent difficulty of the task. Strength is moderate (equivalent n≈10).
-   **Evidence mapping:**
    -   (↑ Large) The most recent report of Threads reaching 400M MAUs in Q3 2025 is powerful evidence that it is at or very near parity with X's likely user base.
    -   (↑ Moderate) The consistent, multi-source reporting of X's user stagnation and decline significantly lowers the threshold for a "YES" resolution.
    -   (↑ Moderate) The demonstrated success of the Instagram integration mechanism validates the core growth thesis, suggesting momentum is sustainable.
    -   (↓ Small) The lack of official, recent MAU numbers from the private company X introduces uncertainty; their numbers could be higher than public estimates suggest.
-   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly supports a "YES" resolution. The posterior probability should be revised significantly upward from the 50% prior. The reported numbers indicate the crossover event is imminent, if it has not already occurred.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
-   **UP indicators:**
    -   An official announcement from Meta/Zuckerberg claiming a new MAU milestone (e.g., "425 million active users").
    -   A major new feature launch on Threads that drives a surge in engagement or media attention.
    -   Another significant technical outage or widely unpopular policy change at X.
    -   Third-party analytics (e.g., Sensor Tower, Similarweb) showing Threads' app usage continuing to trend upwards in Q4 2025.
-   **DOWN indicators:**
    -   A credible, verifiable statement from X/Musk providing an MAU figure substantially higher than 400M.
    -   A report from a reliable source indicating Threads' growth has stalled or reversed in Q4 2025.
    -   Meta executives becoming noticeably silent about Threads' user numbers in upcoming statements.
    -   A significant reversal of controversial policies at X that wins back user goodwill.

### Caveats & pitfalls
-   **Definitional Ambiguity:** The resolution hinges on "Monthly Active User" (MAU). Meta could use a more generous definition than X (e.g., counting passive interaction within Instagram as Threads activity), making a direct comparison misleading.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate for a new social network overtaking an established one is generally low, below 15%. However, given that Threads is a product from a mega-platform like Meta, which has successfully launched other products leveraging its existing user base, a more appropriate base rate is in the 40-60% range. Considering the unique circumstances, such as Twitter's instability and Threads' rapid growth, I will start with a prior probability of 50%.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: Threads is leveraging Meta's massive user base, similar to other successful product launches by tech giants.
   - Differences: Twitter is currently experiencing instability, which is not typical for incumbents in this scenario. This increases the likelihood of Threads overtaking Twitter.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - Threads reaching 400M MAUs in Q3 2025 is strong evidence (↑ Large) that it is close to or has surpassed Twitter's user base. Likelihood ratio significantly favors Threads overtaking Twitter.
   - Reports of Twitter's user stagnation and decline (↑ Moderate) further support the likelihood of Threads surpassing Twitter.
   - The successful integration with Instagram (↑ Moderate) validates the growth strategy, increasing the probability.
   - Lack of recent official MAU numbers from Twitter introduces some uncertainty (↓ Small), but the overall trend supports Threads.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Prior odds: 1 (50% probability)
   - Likelihood ratio: Strongly favors Threads based on the evidence.
   - Posterior odds = Prior odds × Likelihood ratio
   - Given the strong evidence, the posterior probability is significantly higher than the prior. I estimate it to be around 80%.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence risk: Consider the possibility that Twitter's MAUs are underreported or that Threads' growth could stall.
   - Alternative scenario: Twitter stabilizes and retains its user base, but current evidence strongly supports Threads.
   - Adjustments: Given the strong evidence and unique circumstances, the probability remains high.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Considering the base rate, evidence, and potential risks, the final probability reflects the likelihood of Threads reporting more MAUs than Twitter before 2026.

Final: 80%

# Will Threads report more monthly active users than Twitter before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to select an appropriate reference class. There are two relevant ones:

1. **New social media platforms challenging established incumbents**: Historically, most challengers fail to overtake incumbents within a few years (e.g., Google+ vs Facebook, Parler vs Twitter). This reference class would suggest a low prior (~10-15%).

2. **New products from tech giants leveraging existing user bases**: When major platforms like Meta launch new products that integrate with their existing ecosystem (e.g., Instagram Stories vs Snapchat), they have a much higher success rate. This reference class suggests a prior of ~50%.

Given that Threads is built by Meta with Instagram integration, the second reference class is more appropriate. However, this case is unique because Twitter/X is unusually vulnerable due to management changes and user dissatisfaction.

**Prior probability: 50%** (or 1:1 odds)

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Threads is leveraging Meta's massive user base and technical infrastructure
- It's attempting to replicate core functionality of an existing platform
- Network effects are critical to success

**Key differences:**
- Threads had unprecedented initial adoption (100M users in first week)
- Twitter/X is experiencing unusual instability under Elon Musk's leadership
- Meta can operate Threads at a loss longer than most challengers
- The integration with Instagram creates a frictionless onboarding experience

These differences generally make success more likely than the base rate would suggest.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Threads reached 400M MAUs in Q3 2025 (Backlinko report)**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.9) - If Threads will overtake X, we'd expect to see it approaching parity
- P(E|~H): Low (~0.2) - If Threads won't overtake X, it would likely plateau at a lower level
- Likelihood ratio: ~4.5 (strongly increases probability)

**Evidence 2: X's daily active users stalled at ~251M (PCMag report)**
- P(E|H): High (~0.8) - If Threads will overtake X, we'd expect X to be stagnating
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.4) - Even if Threads won't overtake X, X might still face challenges
- Likelihood ratio: ~2 (moderately increases probability)

**Evidence 3: Emarketer projects X to lose millions of users through 2025**
- P(E|H): High (~0.8) - Consistent with conditions for Threads overtaking
- P(E|~H): Low-moderate (~0.3) - Less likely if X were maintaining dominance
- Likelihood ratio: ~2.7 (moderately increases probability)

**Evidence 4: Threads' consistent growth trajectory (275M MAUs in Oct 2024 to 400M in Q3 2025)**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.9) - Sustained growth is necessary for overtaking
- P(E|~H): Low (~0.2) - We'd expect growth to plateau if not on track to overtake
- Likelihood ratio: ~4.5 (strongly increases probability)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 1:1 (50% probability), I'll update based on the strongest evidence first:

**Update on Evidence 1 (400M MAUs):**
- Prior odds: 1:1
- Likelihood ratio: 4.5
- Posterior odds: 4.5:1
- Posterior probability: 4.5/(1+4.5) = 0.818 or ~82%

**Update on Evidence 4 (Growth trajectory):**
- Prior odds: 4.5:1
- Likelihood ratio: 4.5
- Posterior odds: 20.25:1
- Posterior probability: 20.25/(1+20.25) = 0.953 or ~95%

**Update on Evidence 2 (X stagnation) and Evidence 3 (projected losses):**
- Prior odds: 20.25:1
- Combined likelihood ratio: ~5.4
- Posterior odds: 109.35:1
- Posterior probability: 109.35/(1+109.35) = 0.991 or ~99%

This seems too high given remaining uncertainties, so I should adjust.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- We don't have official MAU numbers from X, only estimates and DAU figures
- "Monthly active users" definitions might differ between platforms
- The Manifold market is at only 5.5%, suggesting I may be missing something
- X could implement changes to reverse user decline
- Threads' growth could plateau in the final month of 2025

**Alternative forecast:**
A reasonable alternative would be ~70-80%, acknowledging that while Threads is on track to overtake X, there's still uncertainty about exact user counts and potential changes in trajectory.

**Adjustments:**
Given the uncertainty about X's true MAU count and potential definition differences, I should reduce my confidence. The 400M MAU figure for Threads is very close to historical estimates for X (~368M in Dec 2022), and with X's reported stagnation, the crossover seems likely but not certain.

## 6. Final Forecast

Considering all evidence and uncertainties, I believe Threads is very likely to report more MAUs than Twitter/X before 2026. The most recent data shows Threads at 400M MAUs in Q3 2025, while X appears to be stagnating or declining from its previous ~368M MAU level. The consistent growth trajectory of Threads and multiple indicators of X's user challenges strongly support this conclusion.

However, I must account for uncertainties in measurement, potential changes in trajectory, and the possibility of strategic moves by X in the final month of 2025.

Final: 85%

Here is a step-by-step probabilistic forecast.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

*   **Reference Class:** The most appropriate reference class is not a typical startup social network challenging an incumbent, where the failure rate is extremely high. Instead, it is a "new product launched by a mega-platform (Meta) leveraging an existing, massive user base (Instagram) to compete with a vulnerable incumbent (X/Twitter)."
*   **Base Rate:** Examples in this class include Instagram Stories (vs. Snapchat) and YouTube Shorts (vs. TikTok). These cases have a high rate of success in capturing significant market share. However, unseating an incumbent with strong network effects is still a formidable challenge.
*   **Prior Probability:** A starting prior of **50%** is appropriate. This reflects the powerful advantages Meta possesses (distribution, capital, existing user graph) balanced against the inherent difficulty of migrating a deeply entrenched social network's user base. In odds form, this is 1:1.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities:** Like Instagram Stories, Threads is a direct feature competitor that was able to leverage a parent platform's user base for rapid, low-friction user acquisition, solving the "cold-start" problem.
*   **Differences:** The key difference, which makes this case unique, is the state of the incumbent. Unlike a stable and growing Snapchat or TikTok, Twitter/X has been in a period of significant turmoil since its acquisition. Erratic policy changes, advertiser flight, and alienation of core users have created a powerful "push" factor, actively driving users to seek alternatives. This makes the incumbent far more vulnerable than in a typical base case, suggesting the probability should be adjusted upwards from the prior.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

The provided research report contains some questionable data points (e.g., the 400M MAU figure from Backlinko appears to be a misinterpretation of registered users). I will synthesize the report's information with more reliable public data for a more accurate picture as of November 2025.

*   **Evidence 1: Threads' Growth Trajectory.**
    *   Official Meta reports showed growth from under 100M MAU in October 2023 to over 150M MAU by April 2024.
    *   While the report's more recent figures (320M, 400M) are from less reliable third-party sources, the consistent narrative is one of strong, sustained growth throughout 2024 and 2025. A conservative extrapolation from official numbers suggests Threads' MAU is likely in the **300-350M range** as of late 2025.
    *   This evidence is much more likely if Threads is on a path to surpass X (P(E|H) is high) than if it is not (P(E|~H) is low). This evidence **strongly increases** the probability.

*   **Evidence 2: X's (Twitter's) User Trajectory.**
    *   X's MAU was 368M in late 2022.
    *   Multiple sources, including Emarketer and Statista, project or show a steady decline since the acquisition. Credible estimates place X's current MAU in the **290-330M range**.
    *   This evidence lowers the bar for Threads to clear. A shrinking target is much easier to hit than a growing one. This evidence also **strongly increases** the probability.

*   **Evidence 3: The Crossover Event.**
    *   Comparing the likely ranges (Threads: 300-350M vs. X: 290-330M), it is highly probable that Threads' MAU count has already surpassed X's. The central estimates (e.g., Threads at 325M vs. X at 310M) support this conclusion.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)

*   **Prior Odds:** 1:1 (50% probability).
*   **Updating Step:** The combined evidence that Threads has grown rapidly while X has declined makes the underlying event (Threads MAU > X MAU) extremely likely. This evidence is many times more likely if the hypothesis H ("Threads will report more MAUs than X") is true than if it is false. A conservative combined likelihood ratio for this evidence would be at least 19:1.
    *   Posterior Odds ≈ Prior Odds × Likelihood Ratio
    *   Posterior Odds ≈ 1:1 × 19 = 19:1.
*   **Posterior Probability (of the underlying event):** This corresponds to a probability of 19 / (19 + 1) = **95%**.

However, this is the probability of the *event itself*. The resolution requires that "Meta publicly reports" this before December 31, 2025. This introduces a final point of failure.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

*   **Main Risk:** The biggest reason for a "NO" resolution is not that the crossover won't happen, but that Meta will not *report* it in time. Corporate communications are often tied to quarterly earnings calls. The Q4 2025 earnings call will be in January/February 2026, which is too late. A "YES" resolution requires a standalone announcement (e.g., a blog post, a post from Zuckerberg) in the next ~6 weeks.
*   **Argument for NO:** Meta might choose to wait for the official earnings call to announce the milestone to ensure the data is audited and to present it with full business context. They may not see the value in a rushed, standalone PR announcement.
*   **Argument for YES:** The PR value of announcing that they have overtaken their primary rival is immense. It creates a narrative of momentum that attracts more users and advertisers. The incentives to announce promptly are very strong.
*   **Market Signal:** The Manifold market on this question is trading at ~94%. This indicates a very high degree of confidence from the forecasting community, suggesting they believe the risk of Meta failing to report is very low.
*   **Adjustment:** My 95% confidence in the underlying event must be discounted by the probability of Meta failing to report in time. While the incentives to report are high, it is not a certainty. I will assign a 95% probability that Meta *will* report the milestone before the deadline, given that they have achieved it.

### Final Forecast

My final probability is a combination of the likelihood of the event and the likelihood of it being reported per the resolution criteria.

P(Resolution=YES) = P(Crossover Occurs) × P(Meta Reports | Crossover Occurs)
P(Resolution=YES) = 95% × 95% ≈ 90%

The evidence strongly indicates that Threads' user base has grown to a size that has likely eclipsed the declining user base of X. The primary remaining uncertainty is the timing of Meta's public announcement, but the incentives for a timely report are very strong.

Final: 90%
