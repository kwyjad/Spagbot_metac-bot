### Reference class & base rates
-   **Sub-Saharan African Country-Years (1960-2023):** This broad class provides a general background rate. There have been approximately 100 successful coups over ~2,700 country-years, suggesting a base rate of **~3.7% per year**. This is a weak prior as it ignores country-specific factors.
-   **Long-Running Personalist Autocracies (>30 years rule):** This class is more specific to Cameroon under Paul Biya. Such regimes often exhibit high stability until the ruler's exit, at which point they become extremely fragile. The base rate for a coup in any given year is lower than the average, perhaps **1-2%**, but spikes dramatically during succession periods.
-   **Central African States (since 1990):** This geographic reference class includes countries with similar neighborhood effects and institutional legacies (e.g., CAR, Chad, Congo). This region has a higher-than-average incidence of coups and instability, suggesting a base rate closer to **4-5% per year**.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
-   [2025-05-22] Opposition leader Maurice Kamto calls for mass protests against the extension of parliamentary terms, but turnout is low. (↓) — Demonstrates the opposition's limited ability to mobilize a critical mass, reducing the likelihood of a "popular uprising" style coup trigger.
-   [2025-07-15] Rumors of President Biya's failing health circulate widely on social media after a brief, unannounced trip to Switzerland, prompting a rare public appearance to quell speculation. (↑) — Highlights the fragility of the regime centered on one individual; such events can accelerate plotting among succession rivals.
-   [2025-09-10] EISA report confirms Biya's candidacy for the October election and notes his consolidation of power by extending local officials' terms. (↑) — Signals Biya's intent to retain power, closing off democratic avenues for change and potentially increasing the appeal of extra-constitutional means for rivals.
-   [2025-10-14] Biya is declared the winner of the October 12 presidential election with over 75% of the vote amidst widespread opposition claims of fraud and a low, suppressed turnout. (↑) — A non-credible election can serve as a legitimizing pretext for a military intervention, framed as a move to restore order or democracy.
-   [2025-10-28] Security forces violently disperse small-scale post-election protests in Douala and Bamenda. Several mid-level opposition figures are arrested. (↓) — Shows the security apparatus remains both willing and capable of suppressing dissent, a key deterrent for any coup plotters relying on popular support.
-   [2025-11-05] Biya announces a minor cabinet reshuffle, promoting a general from his own Beti ethnic group to a key defense ministry post. (↓) — A classic coup-proofing move, reinforcing loyalty within the security command structure by placing trusted kinsmen in critical positions.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
-   **Succession Crisis (Large):** Biya is 92 and has no designated successor. His incapacitation or death would likely trigger a chaotic power struggle between internal factions (e.g., led by his son Franck Biya or Secretary-General Ferdinand Ngoh Ngoh) and the military, creating a prime opportunity for a coup.
-   **Elite Fragmentation (Large):** The regime is a complex web of patronage. If a key faction believes it is being sidelined in the succession race, it may be incentivized to launch a preemptive coup to secure its interests before a rival can consolidate power.
-   **Military Cohesion & Loyalty (Large):** Biya has spent 40+ years coup-proofing the military by creating competing units (e.g., Presidential Guard vs. regular army), promoting based on loyalty, and ensuring ethnic balance. A successful coup requires coordination, which this structure is designed to prevent. Any breakdown in this system is a major driver.
-   **Regional Contagion (Small/Moderate):** The "coup belt" in the Sahel has normalized military takeovers as a political tool. While Cameroon is not in the Sahel, the success of juntas in nearby regions could embolden and provide a playbook for disgruntled Cameroonian officers.
-   **Socio-Economic Grievances (Small):** Endemic corruption, youth unemployment, and the long-running Anglophone crisis create a backdrop of popular discontent. However, this is unlikely to directly cause a coup unless it leads to mass, sustained protests that threaten state collapse, providing the military a pretext to intervene.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
-   **Extreme Longevity & Institutionalization of Control:** Unlike many countries in the reference class that experienced recent coups, Biya has been in power for over 40 years. His methods of control, patronage, and surveillance are deeply entrenched and have weathered numerous crises.
-   **Sophisticated Coup-Proofing:** Cameroon's security architecture is deliberately fragmented. The Presidential Guard (Garde Présidentielle) is a powerful, well-equipped force from Biya's own ethnic group whose primary loyalty is to him, acting as a powerful counterweight to the regular army. This is more sophisticated than the structures seen in recent Sahelian coups.
-   **Lack of Recent Coup History:** The last serious coup attempt was in 1984. The military has no living memory or culture of successful intervention, unlike the armed forces in Burkina Faso or Niger. This raises the activation energy required for a plot.
-   **Weak and Divided Opposition:** The political opposition is fragmented and has repeatedly failed to mount a unified, sustained challenge to Biya's rule, reducing the chance of a civilian-led crisis that the military could exploit.
-   **External Actor Ambivalence:** While France's influence is waning, it has historically been a key backer of the Biya regime. There is no clear indication that France or other major powers would support a coup, creating uncertainty for potential plotters.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
-   **Prior:** Start with a low prior derived from the "long-running autocracy" base rate (~1.5% annual risk), adjusted for the very short ~1.5-month horizon. This implies a starting probability well under 1%.
-   **Evidence mapping:**
    -   (↑ Large) Extreme age of ruler and acute succession uncertainty creates a volatile environment.
    -   (↑ Moderate) A recent, non-credible election provides a potential justification for intervention.
    -   (↓ Large) Decades of effective, multi-layered coup-proofing and a fragmented security sector.
    -   (↓ Moderate) Demonstrated loyalty and effectiveness of security forces in quelling recent dissent.
    -   (↓ Small) A weak, divided opposition unable to create a crisis for the military to exploit.
-   **Net effect:** The powerful, long-term structural factors favoring stability (coup-proofing, loyal elites) are likely to outweigh the event-driven risks (election, age) over the very short remaining time horizon. The posterior should be revised slightly upwards from the initial low prior but should remain in the low single digits.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
-   **UP indicators:**
    -   Unusual or unscheduled movements of military units, particularly around the capital, Yaoundé.
    -   Credible reports of President Biya's serious illness, incapacitation, or death.
    -   Arrest or dismissal of a high-ranking general or security chief (could signal a failed plot or a preemptive purge).
    -   Public statements of discontent from within the ruling CPDM party or security forces.
    -   Sustained, large-scale protests that overwhelm security services.
-   **DOWN indicators:**
    -   Biya appears in public looking healthy and in command.
    -   Key military leaders issue public pledges of loyalty to the President.
    -   Successful distribution of patronage (e.g., promotions, bonuses) to key security units.
    -   Opposition leaders are arrested or flee, further weakening any civilian challenge.
    -   Business-as-usual functioning of the state bureaucracy.

### Caveats & pitfalls
-   **Opacity of the Regime:** The inner workings of the Cameroonian power structure are notoriously opaque. Information is tightly controlled, and rumors are rampant, making it difficult to distinguish signal from noise.
-   **"Black Swan" Event:** Coups are often planned in secret by small circles and can occur with little to no public warning. The first indicator may be the coup itself.
-   **Succession vs. Coup:** Biya's death could lead to an unconstitutional seizure of power by an insider (e.g., Ngoh Ngoh using the security apparatus) that might not fit the "armed group" definition perfectly but would be a de facto coup.
-   **Definition of "Successful":** A coup attempt could occur but fail to hold power for the required 7 days. The initial event risk is higher than the risk of a *successful* coup.
-   **Short Horizon:** With less than two months to resolution, the probability of a complex event like a coup materializing is inherently low, but any triggering event (e.g., Biya's death) would cause the probability to spike instantaneously.

**Final Research Summary:** The risk of a coup is elevated due to President Biya's advanced age and the recent contested election, but the probability of a *successful* coup before 2026 remains low due to his deeply entrenched and sophisticated coup-proofing structures that have maintained stability for four decades.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - For the base rate, I will use the "Long-Running Personalist Autocracies (>30 years rule)" class, which suggests a base rate of 1-2% per year for a coup. Given the short time frame of less than two months until the end of 2025, this base rate translates to a very low probability, well under 1%. This choice is due to the specific nature of Paul Biya's regime, which has shown high stability over decades.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: Cameroon under Biya fits the profile of a long-running personalist autocracy with entrenched power structures and coup-proofing measures.
   - Differences: The current situation includes heightened succession uncertainty due to Biya's age and recent contested elections, which could increase the risk compared to the base case.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Biya's Age and Health Rumors**: Increases the likelihood of a coup due to potential succession crises. Likelihood ratio > 1.
   - **Contested Election**: Provides a potential justification for a coup, increasing the likelihood. Likelihood ratio > 1.
   - **Coup-Proofing and Security Loyalty**: Decreases the likelihood of a successful coup. Likelihood ratio < 1.
   - **Weak Opposition**: Decreases the likelihood as it reduces the chance of a civilian-led crisis. Likelihood ratio < 1.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Starting with a prior probability of under 1% due to the short time frame.
   - The evidence of Biya's age and the contested election slightly increases the probability, but the strong coup-proofing and weak opposition significantly counterbalance this.
   - Posterior probability remains low, likely around 1-2%, given the strong structural factors favoring stability.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence could arise from underestimating the impact of Biya's potential sudden incapacitation. However, the entrenched coup-proofing measures are robust.
   - An alternative scenario could involve a sudden health crisis for Biya, but the probability remains low without clear indicators.
   - Adjustments: Consider a slight increase to account for the non-zero risk of sudden health events.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Considering all factors, the probability of a successful coup in Cameroon before 2026 remains low, but slightly higher than the base rate due to recent developments.
   - Final: 2%

# Will there be a successful coup in Cameroon before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to establish an appropriate base rate for the probability of a successful coup in Cameroon before January 1, 2026 (about 1.5 months from now).

The most relevant reference classes suggest:
- Sub-Saharan African countries: ~3.7% annual coup risk
- Long-running personalist autocracies (>30 years): ~1-2% annual coup risk
- Central African states since 1990: ~4-5% annual coup risk

Given that Cameroon falls into all three categories but is most specifically characterized by Biya's 40+ year rule and sophisticated coup-proofing measures, I'll use the long-running personalist autocracy reference class as my primary base rate: 1.5% annual risk.

For a 1.5-month period, this translates to approximately:
1.5% × (1.5/12) = 0.1875% base rate

However, this needs adjustment because:
1. The end of a long-running autocracy is a high-risk period
2. The recent contested election increases risk
3. Biya's advanced age (92) creates succession uncertainty

I'll adjust the base rate to approximately 1% for this 1.5-month period as my prior.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Cameroon is an African state with a personalist autocratic regime
- The country has ethnic divisions that could be exploited
- There are underlying socioeconomic grievances
- The region has experienced coups in recent years

**Key differences:**
- Biya has ruled for over 40 years (since 1982), making his regime exceptionally entrenched
- Cameroon has sophisticated coup-proofing measures with competing security units
- The last serious coup attempt was in 1984, creating no recent "coup culture"
- The opposition is particularly weak and fragmented
- The Presidential Guard is extremely loyal and well-equipped
- The time horizon is very short (only 1.5 months)

These differences, particularly the sophisticated coup-proofing and short time horizon, suggest a lower probability than the typical case.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Biya's advanced age (92) and succession uncertainty**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.9) - If a coup were to occur, it would likely be related to succession issues
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.5) - Even without a coup, succession concerns exist
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.8 (increases probability)

**Evidence 2: Recent contested election with claims of fraud**
- P(E|H): High (~0.8) - Contested elections often precede coups
- P(E|~H): High (~0.7) - Contested elections are common in Cameroon without leading to coups
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.14 (slightly increases probability)

**Evidence 3: Effective suppression of post-election protests**
- P(E|H): Low (~0.2) - Successful coups typically follow failed state responses
- P(E|~H): High (~0.8) - Effective protest suppression indicates regime control
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.25 (significantly decreases probability)

**Evidence 4: Recent cabinet reshuffle promoting loyal ethnic allies**
- P(E|H): Low (~0.3) - Coups typically follow when loyalty systems break down
- P(E|~H): High (~0.8) - Such reshuffles are typical coup-proofing measures
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.375 (significantly decreases probability)

**Evidence 5: Regional contagion from Sahel coups**
- P(E|H): Moderate (~0.6) - Regional contagion can inspire copycat coups
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.5) - Regional effects exist regardless of outcome
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.2 (slightly increases probability)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior of 1%, I'll update based on the key evidence:

**Update on Biya's age and succession uncertainty:**
- Prior odds: 0.01/0.99 = 0.0101
- Posterior odds: 0.0101 × 1.8 = 0.0182
- Posterior probability: 0.0182/(1+0.0182) ≈ 1.79%

**Update on effective protest suppression:**
- Prior odds: 0.0179/0.9821 = 0.0182
- Posterior odds: 0.0182 × 0.25 = 0.00455
- Posterior probability: 0.00455/(1+0.00455) ≈ 0.45%

**Update on loyal cabinet reshuffle:**
- Prior odds: 0.0045/0.9955 = 0.00452
- Posterior odds: 0.00452 × 0.375 = 0.00169
- Posterior probability: 0.00169/(1+0.00169) ≈ 0.17%

**Update on regional contagion:**
- Prior odds: 0.0017/0.9983 = 0.0017
- Posterior odds: 0.0017 × 1.2 = 0.00204
- Posterior probability: 0.00204/(1+0.00204) ≈ 0.2%

**Update on contested election:**
- Prior odds: 0.002/0.998 = 0.002
- Posterior odds: 0.002 × 1.14 = 0.00228
- Posterior probability: 0.00228/(1+0.00228) ≈ 0.23%

After these updates, my posterior probability is approximately 0.23%.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the fragility of the regime given Biya's age
- Coups often occur with little warning, and internal plotting is opaque
- The short time horizon might be causing me to underestimate risk
- I might be overestimating the effectiveness of Biya's coup-proofing

**Alternative scenarios:**
- Biya could suddenly die or become incapacitated, triggering a power struggle
- A faction within the security forces could act preemptively if they fear being sidelined
- External actors could provide unexpected support for a coup attempt
- The Anglophone crisis could suddenly escalate, creating a pretext for military intervention

**Best alternative forecast:**
A more pessimistic forecast might place the probability at 2-3%, arguing that:
1. Personalist regimes are extremely vulnerable during succession periods
2. The recent election created grievances that could be exploited
3. The regional contagion effect is stronger than I've estimated

**Rebuttal to alternative:**
While these concerns are valid, the extremely short time horizon (1.5 months) significantly constrains the probability. Additionally, Biya's coup-proofing measures have been tested and proven effective over decades, not just years.

Given these considerations, I'll adjust my forecast slightly upward to account for the inherent uncertainty and opacity of the regime, but maintain a low probability given the short time horizon and structural factors.

## 6. Final Forecast

After considering the base rates, evidence, and potential blind spots, I assess that the probability of a successful coup in Cameroon before 2026 (in the next 1.5 months) is very low but not impossible.

Final: 0.5%

Here is a probabilistic forecast following the specified methodology.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
To establish a prior probability, I will use a reference class of "long-running personalist autocracies," defined as regimes where a single leader has held power for over 30 years. Paul Biya has been in power since 1982 (43 years as of 2025), making this a highly relevant class. These regimes are typically very stable due to entrenched systems of control and coup-proofing, but become extremely vulnerable during succession. Historical data for this class suggests a low annual probability of a coup, around 1-2%.

Given the very short time horizon of this question (from today, November 13, 2025, to the resolution date of January 1, 2026, is approximately 1.5 months or 0.125 years), the initial prior is very low. Using a 2% annual rate:
Prior P(H) = 1 - (1 - 0.02)^0.125 ≈ 0.0025, or **0.25%**.
This initial prior represents the chance of a coup in a "normal" period for such a regime, assuming the leader remains in power.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
**Similarities:** Cameroon under Biya exhibits the classic traits of a long-running autocracy: a centralized power structure, extensive patronage networks, a weak and fragmented opposition, and significant investment in security forces loyal to the leader.

**Differences:**
*   **Extreme Age of Leader:** At 92, President Biya is at an advanced age where the risk of death or incapacitation is a dominant factor. This makes the current situation far more volatile than an average year for the reference class, as his exit is the most likely trigger for a succession crisis and, potentially, a coup.
*   **Recent Contested Election:** The hypothetical October 2025 election, described as fraudulent, creates a specific grievance and a potential pretext for military intervention, concentrating risk in the current period.
*   **Sophisticated Coup-Proofing:** Biya's regime is noted for its particularly effective and multi-layered coup-proofing, such as creating rival security units (e.g., the Presidential Guard vs. the regular army) and managing appointments based on ethnic and personal loyalty. This may make Cameroon more resilient to coups than the average autocracy in the base case.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
The core of the problem can be broken down into two mutually exclusive scenarios:
1.  President Biya survives until January 1, 2026.
2.  President Biya dies or is incapacitated before January 1, 2026.

The probability of a coup is vastly different in these two scenarios.

*   **Evidence for Stability (if Biya survives):** The research report highlights the regime's recent actions that demonstrate its control. The effective suppression of post-election protests and the cabinet reshuffle to place a loyalist in a key defense post are strong evidence (Likelihood Ratio < 1) that the coup-proofing mechanisms are functioning as intended. This suggests the probability of a coup against a living and functioning Biya remains low, consistent with the base rate.
*   **Evidence for Instability (if Biya dies):** The primary driver of risk is Biya's age. His death would almost certainly trigger a power struggle. The research report identifies this "Succession Crisis" as a major driver. The likelihood of a coup attempt in this scenario is very high (Likelihood Ratio >> 1).

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Instead of updating a single prior, I will model the two key scenarios.

**P(Coup) = P(Coup | Biya Dies) * P(Biya Dies) + P(Coup | Biya Survives) * P(Biya Survives)**

1.  **P(Biya Dies):** The actuarial probability of death for a 92-year-old male in the next 1.5 months is significant. Based on standard life tables (e.g., US SSA qx ≈ 0.18 for a year), the probability for a 1.5-month period is roughly `1 - (1 - 0.18)^0.125 ≈ 2.4%`. Let's use **P(Biya Dies) = 2.5%**. This means **P(Biya Survives) = 97.5%**.

2.  **P(Coup | Biya Dies):** If Biya dies, a chaotic succession struggle is highly likely. The definition requires a *successful* coup (holding power for 7+ days). While a power grab is probable, it might be consolidated by an insider without meeting the definition, or a coup attempt could fail. I estimate the probability of a successful coup, given his death, at **30%**.

3.  **P(Coup | Biya Survives):** This is the probability of a coup in the next 1.5 months if Biya remains in power. The base rate for a stable year is low (~2% annually). However, the post-election period is one of heightened tension. I will triple the base annual risk to 6% to account for this. For 1.5 months, this is `1 - (1 - 0.06)^0.125 ≈ 0.8%`. Let's use **P(Coup | Biya Survives) = 0.8%**.

**Calculation:**
P(Coup) = (0.30 * 0.025) + (0.008 * 0.975)
P(Coup) = 0.0075 + 0.0078
P(Coup) = 0.0153 ≈ **1.5%**

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast of 1.5% is significantly lower than the Metaculus community's current 4%. For the probability to be 4%, the risk would have to be much higher in one or both scenarios. For example, it would require P(Coup | Biya Survives) to be ~2.1% for the period (a ~16% annual rate) and P(Coup | Biya Dies) to be ~80%. These figures seem too high given the regime's 40-year history of stability and effective suppression of dissent. The community forecast may not have fully adjusted for the very short time remaining.

The biggest risk to my forecast is underestimating the fragility of the regime. The coup-proofing that looks like a strength (fragmented security forces) could itself be the source of conflict during a crisis. A "black swan" event, where a small, secret conspiracy succeeds with no warning, is always possible in such an opaque regime. To account for this model uncertainty and opacity, I will round my final forecast up slightly.

### 6. Final Forecast
The probability is dominated by two factors: the small but real chance of President Biya's death triggering a succession crisis, and a slightly elevated risk of a coup in the tense post-election environment even if he survives. Combining these scenarios yields a probability of approximately 1.5%. Adjusting slightly upward for the inherent unpredictability of coups in opaque regimes, I arrive at a final probability of 2%.

Final: 2%
