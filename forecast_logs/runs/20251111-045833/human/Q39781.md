### Reference class & base rates
1.  **States of Emergency (SoEs) under President Noboa (Nov 2023 - Present):** Noboa has frequently used SoEs to address security and social crises. He declared a nationwide (24-province) SoE in January 2024 for 60 days against gang violence, and other more localized ones. This suggests a high propensity to use the tool, but also that they are time-bound. The base rate for the number of provinces under an SoE on any given day in his presidency is high, but the distribution is bimodal: either 0, or a large number (e.g., 7, 16, 24).
2.  **Major Ecuadorian Indigenous Protests (2000-2025):** Large-scale protests, particularly led by the indigenous confederation CONAIE over economic policies (like fuel subsidies), are a recurring feature of Ecuadorian politics (e.g., 2019, 2022). These events typically trigger a presidential declaration of an SoE covering multiple provinces. Historically, these crises last several weeks and usually end in a negotiated settlement, leading to the lifting of the SoE. This class suggests that while SoEs are a common response, they are temporary measures to manage an acute crisis that is ultimately resolved politically. The base rate here favors 0 provinces, as the crisis state is the exception, not the norm.
3.  **Ecuadorian Constitutional SoE Durations:** The Ecuadorian Constitution limits SoEs to 60 days, with one possible 30-day extension, subject to review by the Constitutional Court. This creates a strong legal default for any SoE to end within 90 days. The current SoE, declared October 4-6, will expire around December 3-5. This reference class suggests a high probability of the SoE ending before the December 25 resolution date, unless it is extended.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-10-08** Government frames attack on Noboa's convoy as an "assassination attempt" and arrests suspects on terrorism charges. — ↑ — Hardens the government's stance, making a negotiated de-escalation less likely and providing strong justification for extending the SoE.
*   **2025-10-06** SoE is expanded to 16 provinces, including major economic hubs like Guayas. — ↑ — Indicates the protests are widespread and escalating, increasing the government's perceived need for emergency powers.
*   **2025-10-04** President Noboa declares a 60-day SoE in 10 provinces in response to protests over diesel subsidy cuts. — ↑ — This is the primary event, establishing the current state of 10+ provinces under emergency rule.
*   **2025-09-16** A state of emergency is declared in Carchi and Imbabura provinces due to security concerns predating the protests. — ↑ — Shows a pre-existing willingness to use SoEs for security and that these two provinces may remain under an SoE even if the protest-related one is lifted.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Protest Intensity & Stamina:** The primary driver. Sustained, large-scale mobilization by indigenous and social groups (like CONAIE) pressures the government and justifies the SoE. If protests wane, the justification disappears. (Large)
2.  **Government Negotiation vs. Suppression Strategy:** Noboa's choice between a hardline, security-focused approach (framing protesters as terrorists) and a political one (negotiating on subsidies) will determine the conflict's duration. A shift to dialogue is the main off-ramp. (Large)
3.  **Constitutional Clock & Judicial Review:** The 60-day limit on the current SoE expires in early December. The government must make an active decision to extend it, which could be challenged or struck down by the Constitutional Court. This is a key forcing mechanism for de-escalation. (Moderate)
4.  **Fiscal Imperatives:** The government's commitment to subsidy cuts is likely driven by severe fiscal constraints or IMF agreements. This reduces its flexibility to concede to protester demands, potentially prolonging the conflict. (Moderate)
5.  **Holiday Season Effect:** The upcoming Christmas holiday period is a powerful, traditional de-escalator in Latin America. Both protesters and security forces are less likely to maintain high operational tempo, creating a natural window for a "truce" or lifting the SoE. (Moderate)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Noboa's Hardline Rhetoric:** Unlike some predecessors who engaged in dialogue more quickly, Noboa's administration has immediately framed the protests as linked to foreign cartels and terrorism. This escalatory rhetoric makes a quick, negotiated settlement more difficult than in past protest cycles.
*   **Conflation of Security and Social Crises:** The government is simultaneously fighting a well-documented war against powerful drug gangs. It is using this context to frame the social protests as another front in the security war, potentially leading to a more militarized and prolonged response than typical for subsidy protests.
*   **Proximity to SoE Expiration:** The resolution date (Dec 25) falls just three weeks after the initial 60-day SoE is set to expire. This makes the forecast almost entirely dependent on a single binary event: whether the government extends the SoE in early December.
*   **"Assassination Attempt" Narrative:** The alleged attack on Noboa's convoy provides the government with a powerful justification to maintain and extend the SoE, framing it as a necessary measure to protect state stability and the president's life, a stronger claim than managing protests alone.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a prior centered on **0 provinces**, reflecting the base rate that protest-driven SoEs are temporary and usually resolved within their initial 60-day term (equivalent n ≈ 10). The prior should have some weight on higher numbers, acknowledging Noboa's frequent use of SoEs.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   Noboa's hardline rhetoric and framing of protesters as terrorists (↑, Large)
    *   The rapid escalation and expansion of the SoE to 16 provinces (↑, Moderate)
    *   The "assassination attempt" narrative solidifying the government's position (↑, Moderate)
    *   The impending Christmas holiday, a natural de-escalation point (↓, Moderate)
    *   The constitutional requirement for the SoE to expire in early December (↓, Moderate)
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly pushes the probability mass away from zero. The government's escalatory actions and rhetoric significantly increase the likelihood of an extension past the initial 60 days. The posterior should shift upwards, with significant probability now on the outcome being 16 provinces, while still retaining a mode at 0 due to the powerful holiday and constitutional expiration mechanisms.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Official announcement in early December that the SoE will be extended for 30 days.
    *   Major new violent clashes between protesters and security forces.
    *   Failure of any preliminary talks or dialogue initiatives.
    *   Sustained high approval ratings for Noboa's hardline stance.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Announcement of a formal dialogue between the government and CONAIE.
    *   A Constitutional Court ruling limiting or striking down the SoE.
    *   A significant, visible decrease in the size and frequency of protests.
    *   The government offers a compromise, such as a targeted compensation scheme to offset subsidy cuts.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Definitional Ambiguity:** An SoE might be lifted in some provinces but not others. The two provinces under a pre-existing SoE (Carchi, Imbabura) might remain so, even if the 14 protest-related ones are cleared. The resolution could be a number other than 0 or 16.
*   **Sudden Resolution:** These standoffs can end abruptly. A back-channel deal could be reached, leading to a sudden lifting of the SoE with little warning.
*   **Information Asymmetry:** Reporting will be heavily influenced by government and opposition narratives. The true

To produce a probabilistic forecast for the number of provinces in Ecuador that will be in a state of emergency on December 25, 2025, we will follow the structured Bayesian reasoning process.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Base Rate Selection:** The base rate is informed by historical patterns of state of emergency (SoE) declarations in Ecuador, particularly under President Noboa. Historically, SoEs are temporary measures, often resolved within their initial term. However, Noboa's administration has shown a propensity to use SoEs frequently and for extended periods.
- **Base Rate Characteristics:** The base rate distribution is bimodal, with peaks at 0 (reflecting the temporary nature of SoEs) and at higher numbers (reflecting Noboa's frequent use of SoEs). The mean might be around 8, with a high variance due to the bimodal nature.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** The current situation involves large-scale protests, similar to past events that led to SoEs.
- **Differences:** The hardline rhetoric and framing of protests as linked to terrorism are more pronounced, potentially leading to a prolonged SoE.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Hardline Rhetoric and Terrorism Framing:** Increases the likelihood of maintaining or extending the SoE (↑, Large).
- **Expansion to 16 Provinces:** Suggests a significant escalation, increasing the likelihood of a continued SoE (↑, Moderate).
- **Assassination Attempt Narrative:** Provides strong justification for maintaining the SoE (↑, Moderate).
- **Constitutional Expiration and Holiday Season:** These factors suggest a natural de-escalation and potential lifting of the SoE (↓, Moderate).

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
- **Prior:** Start with a prior centered on 0 provinces, acknowledging the temporary nature of SoEs.
- **Evidence Mapping:** The evidence largely pushes the distribution towards higher numbers, particularly due to the government's hardline stance.
- **Posterior Shift:** The posterior distribution shifts upwards, with significant probability on 16 provinces, but still retains a mode at 0 due to constitutional and holiday factors.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the possibility of a sudden resolution or a partial lifting of the SoE.
- **Tail Risks:** The risk of a complete lifting of the SoE or a further escalation leading to a nationwide SoE.
- **Alternative Forecast:** A plausible alternative is a partial lifting, resulting in a number between 0 and 16.

### 6. Final Percentiles
- **Calibrated Percentiles:**
  - P10: 0 (reflecting the possibility of a complete resolution)
  - P20: 4 (considering a partial lifting)
  - P40: 8 (balancing between partial lifting and continuation)
  - P60: 12 (leaning towards continuation in several provinces)
  - P80: 16 (reflecting the current state)
  - P90: 16 (accounting for the hardline stance and justification for continuation)

P20: 4  
P40: 8  
P60: 12

# Forecast: How many provinces in Ecuador will be in a state of emergency on December 25, 2025?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll use multiple reference classes to establish a prior:

**Historical States of Emergency (SoE) in Ecuador:**
- Ecuador has 24 provinces total
- Under President Noboa (2023-present), SoEs have been frequent but time-limited
- The constitutional limit is 60 days with a possible 30-day extension (90 days maximum)
- Current SoE was declared October 4-6, 2025 in 16 provinces, which would expire in early December before the resolution date
- Base rate suggests either 0 provinces or a large number (7+ provinces)

**Indigenous Protest Resolution Patterns:**
- Major indigenous protests (2019, 2022, etc.) typically end with negotiated settlements
- These settlements usually result in lifting SoEs
- The base rate from this reference class suggests 0 provinces is most likely by December 25

Prior distribution:
- Mean: ~4 provinces
- Median: 0 provinces
- With significant probability mass at 0 and 16-24 provinces (bimodal)

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate:**
- The current situation follows a familiar pattern of indigenous protests against economic reforms
- The constitutional 60-day limit applies, pushing toward expiration before December 25
- Christmas season typically reduces protest intensity in Latin America

**Key differences:**
- Noboa has framed protesters as terrorists and linked to cartels, escalating rhetoric beyond typical protest responses
- The alleged "assassination attempt" provides stronger justification for maintaining emergency powers
- The SoE covers 16 provinces, showing widespread unrest beyond localized issues
- Two provinces (Carchi and Imbabura) were already under SoE before the protests

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence for higher values:**
- Noboa's hardline rhetoric framing protesters as terrorists (strong upward push)
- Rapid expansion to 16 provinces shows widespread unrest (moderate upward push)
- "Assassination attempt" narrative provides strong justification for extension (strong upward push)
- Pre-existing SoE in two provinces suggests security concerns beyond protests (weak upward push)

**Evidence for lower values:**
- Constitutional 60-day limit expires in early December (strong downward push)
- Christmas holiday period typically reduces protest intensity (moderate downward push)
- Historical pattern of negotiated settlements ending in lifted SoEs (moderate downward push)
- Economic pressure to resolve disruptions before year-end (weak downward push)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior centered on 0 provinces but with significant mass at higher values:

**First update - Constitutional expiration:**
- The current SoE expires around December 3-5
- Without active extension, this pushes strongly toward 0 provinces
- However, the government can extend for 30 more days, which would cover December 25
- This shifts probability mass toward either 0 or 16 provinces

**Second update - Escalatory rhetoric:**
- Noboa's terrorism framing and "assassination attempt" narrative
- This significantly increases likelihood of extension
- Shifts more probability mass toward 16 provinces
- Posterior now has significant weight at both 0 and 16 provinces

**Third update - Holiday season effect:**
- Christmas period creates natural de-escalation opportunity
- This moderately increases probability of 0 provinces
- But doesn't eliminate the substantial probability of extension

Posterior distribution now has:
- Increased mean to ~7 provinces
- Bimodal with peaks at 0 and 16 provinces
- Reduced probability of intermediate values (1-15 provinces)

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overestimating the Christmas effect in a security context
- The "assassination attempt" narrative could justify indefinite emergency measures
- I might be underestimating the possibility of partial lifting (some provinces but not others)
- The Constitutional Court could intervene to limit or strike down extensions

**Alternative scenarios:**
- Partial lifting scenario: Government might maintain SoE in core protest areas but lift in others
- Escalation scenario: New violence could trigger nationwide SoE (all 24 provinces)
- Judicial intervention: Court could force lifting despite government preference

I should adjust my distribution to:
- Place more weight on intermediate values (2-10 provinces)
- Slightly reduce confidence in the 0 provinces outcome
- Maintain significant weight at 16 provinces

## 6. Final Percentiles

P10: 0
P20: 0
P40: 2
P60: 12
P80: 16
P90: 18

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The primary base rate is derived from the constitutional limits on States of Emergency (SoEs) in Ecuador. The constitution limits an SoE to 60 days, with one possible 30-day extension. The current protest-related SoE was declared on October 4-6, 2025. This means its initial 60-day term will expire around December 3-5, 2025, which is *before* the resolution date of December 25.

Therefore, the strong prior or default state is that the SoE will have expired. This suggests a prior distribution heavily concentrated at **0 provinces**. Historically, protest-driven SoEs are temporary crisis-management tools, not permanent states, reinforcing a prior centered on zero. The mean and median of this prior are both 0, with a small probability mass at higher numbers to account for the possibility of extensions.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities:** The current situation fits a recurring pattern in Ecuador: major protests, often led by indigenous groups like CONAIE, over economic policies like fuel subsidy cuts, leading to a government-declared SoE. Typically, these end in a negotiated settlement and the lifting of the SoE.

**Differences:**
1.  **President Noboa's Hardline Stance:** Noboa's administration has immediately framed the protests as being linked to foreign cartels and terrorism. This escalatory rhetoric makes a swift, negotiated settlement less likely than in historical cases.
2.  **"Assassination Attempt" Narrative:** The alleged attack on Noboa's convoy provides the government with a powerful and unusual justification to extend the SoE on grounds of presidential security and state stability, a stronger rationale than simply managing protests.
3.  **Conflation of Crises:** The government is leveraging the ongoing, severe security crisis with drug gangs to frame this social protest through a security lens, potentially justifying a more prolonged, militarized response.

These differences suggest that the likelihood of the SoE being extended beyond its initial 60-day term is significantly higher than the historical base rate for similar protest events.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will model the outcome by breaking it down into two key, independent-seeming events:
1.  The fate of the SoE in the 14 provinces related to the protests.
2.  The fate of the pre-existing SoE in 2 provinces (Carchi and Imbabura) for security reasons.

*   **Protest SoE (14 provinces):**
    *   **Evidence for extension (↑):** Noboa's hardline rhetoric, the "assassination attempt" narrative, and the severity of the protests provide strong political cover and justification for a 30-day extension into January.
    *   **Evidence against extension (↓):** The constitutional clock creates a default of expiration. The approaching Christmas holiday season creates strong social pressure for de-escalation and a "truce."
    *   **Likelihood:** The competing pressures are both very strong. The government's justification for extension is high, but the forces for de-escalation are also powerful. I estimate a **40% chance the protest SoE is extended** and a 60% chance it is allowed to expire.

*   **Security SoE (2 provinces):**
    *   This SoE was declared on September 16 and is independent of the protests. Its initial 60-day term expires around November 15.
    *   **Likelihood:** Given Ecuador's ongoing and severe general security crisis, it is plausible this more localized, security-focused SoE will be renewed. I estimate a **50% chance this 2-province SoE is extended**.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

My prior was heavily skewed to 0. The evidence of the government's hardline stance and the specific justifications it has created (terrorism links, assassination attempt) significantly increases the probability of an extension, pulling the distribution upwards.

I combine the probabilities of the two events to build a posterior distribution:
*   **Scenario 1: Both SoEs expire.** (Protest SoE lapses AND Security SoE lapses).
    *   Probability: 60% * 50% = **30%**
    *   Outcome: **0 provinces**
*   **Scenario 2: Protest SoE expires, Security SoE extends.**
    *   Probability: 60% * 50% = **30%**
    *   Outcome: **2 provinces**
*   **Scenario 3: Protest SoE extends, Security SoE expires.**
    *   Probability: 40% * 50% = **20%**
    *   Outcome: **14 provinces**
*   **Scenario 4: Both SoEs extend.**
    *   Probability: 40% * 50% = **20%**
    *   Outcome: **16 provinces**

This creates a multi-modal posterior distribution with peaks at 0, 2, 14, and 16. The median of this distribution is 2, and the mean is (0.3*0) + (0.3*2) + (0.2*14) + (0.2*16) = 0 + 0.6 + 2.8 + 3.2 = 6.6.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My forecast is highly dependent on the assumption that the two SoEs (protest-related and security-related) can be treated as independent events. It's possible the government will bundle them, either extending both or neither. If they are perfectly correlated, the outcomes would be P(0)=60% and P(16)=40%. This would shift the distribution, making the median 0 and the P80/P90 values 16. However, the reasons for the SoEs are distinct, so assuming some independence seems more robust.

Another risk is a partial resolution, where the SoE is lifted in some protest provinces but not others. This is less likely as the SoE was a bloc response to a single crisis, but it could happen. This would smooth the distribution between 2 and 14, but the primary modes are likely to remain. My current model, with its discrete jumps, correctly captures the most plausible scenarios. The four-scenario model seems like a reasonable and defensible simplification of a complex reality.

### 6. Final Percentiles

The final percentiles are derived from the cumulative distribution of the four scenarios calculated above:
*   P(X ≤ 0) = 30%
*   P(X ≤ 2) = 30% + 30% = 60%
*   P(X ≤ 14) = 60% + 20% = 80%
*   P(X ≤ 16) = 80% + 20% = 100%
