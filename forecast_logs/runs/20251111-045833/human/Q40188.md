### **Research Plan**

1.  **Identify Core Questions:**
    *   What is the typical duration of U.S. animal health-related import suspensions? (To establish a reference class).
    *   What are the biological and operational timelines for controlling a New World Screwworm (NWS) outbreak using the Sterile Insect Technique (SIT)? (To understand the core mechanism).
    *   What is the history and nature of U.S.-Mexico cooperation on NWS eradication? (To assess institutional capacity).
    *   What are the economic and political pressures for and against reopening the border? (To identify key drivers).
    *   What are the specific USDA/APHIS criteria for lifting such a suspension? (To define success conditions and indicators).

2.  **Propose Search Queries:**
    *   `USDA APHIS import ban duration animal disease`
    *   `history of US livestock import bans foot and mouth disease BSE`
    *   `New World Screwworm life cycle`
    *   `Sterile Insect Technique screwworm eradication timeline`
    *   `US-Mexico Commission for the Prevention of Foot-and-Mouth Disease and Other Exotic Animal Diseases COMEXA`
    *   `economic impact US Mexico cattle import suspension`
    *   `USDA protocol for lifting screwworm quarantine`

3.  **Synthesize Key Findings:**
    *   Historical bans vary widely (months to decades), but those for treatable/eradicable pests with existing cooperative frameworks are on the shorter end (3-12 months).
    *   The NWS life cycle is ~21 days. Eradication requires sustained release of sterile flies and intensive surveillance. A common international standard for declaring an area free of a pest is a period of 3-6 months (several life cycles) after the last detection.
    *   The U.S. and Mexico have a long-standing, highly successful joint commission (COMEXA) that eradicated NWS from Mexico and maintains a permanent barrier in Panama. This institutional capacity is a major asset.
    *   Economic pressure is significant. The U.S. feedlot industry relies on over a million head of feeder cattle from Mexico annually. The July reopening attempt, though brief, signals this pressure.
    *   The USDA's primary driver is zero-risk tolerance for NWS re-establishment in the U.S. The quick re-imposition of the ban on July 9 after a new case demonstrates this caution will override economic pressure if the pest is not fully contained. Reopening will require Mexico to provide robust, verifiable data showing a sustained period without new cases in the border region.

4.  **Draft Comprehensive Answer:**
    *   Proceed to draft the brief using the required headings, integrating the synthesized findings.

### Reference class & base rates
*   **Broad Class: U.S. Animal Health Import Bans.** These suspensions vary dramatically in duration, from months to decades. Bans for highly persistent diseases with no easy cure (e.g., Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy/BSE from the UK) have lasted 20+ years. Bans for more manageable, localized outbreaks (e.g., certain strains of Avian Influenza) can be resolved in 6-18 months. The base rate for a ban being lifted within 8 months (the approximate timeframe from May 2025 to Jan 2026) is perhaps **30-40%**.
*   **Narrow Class: U.S. Pest-Related Import Bans with Pre-existing Cooperative Eradication Programs.** This is a more appropriate reference class. The U.S. and Mexico have a long-standing joint commission (COMEXA) and a proven method (Sterile Insect Technique) for NWS. In such cases, the timeline is dictated by the pest's life cycle and the time needed for surveillance to confirm eradication. This points to a shorter duration, typically 3-9 months. The base rate for resolution within 8 months in this class is significantly higher, perhaps **60-70%**.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   [2025-11-04] USDA Secretary Rollins states she is "pleased with Mexico's efforts" but is "not ready" to lift the ban. — (↑) — Positive tone and high-level engagement are good signs, but the lack of a timeline tempers optimism.
*   [2025-07-09] U.S. re-imposes the full suspension of Mexican livestock imports after a new NWS case is detected. — (↓↓) — This is the most significant recent event. It demonstrates the low risk tolerance of the USDA and resets the clock on any surveillance period required for reopening.
*   [2025-07-07] U.S. briefly reopens the border to Mexican livestock imports. — (↑) — Shows that both sides are actively working towards and are capable of implementing a reopening, indicating procedural barriers are low.
*   [2025-05-11] U.S. initially suspends imports of cattle from Mexico due to NWS concerns. — (↓) — The initiating event.
*   [2025-05-01] U.S.-Mexico agreement ensures USDA aircraft and equipment for NWS eradication can operate freely in Mexico. — (↑) — Confirms the pre-existing cooperative framework was activated immediately, a strong positive structural factor.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **NWS Eradication Efficacy:** The success of the Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) campaign in Mexico is the primary driver. The key is eliminating wild NWS populations, especially near the border. (Large)
*   **USDA Risk Tolerance:** The USDA's mandate is to protect the U.S. livestock industry. Their aversion to risk is extremely high, as a domestic NWS outbreak would be catastrophic. The July 9 reversal proves caution trumps economics. (Large)
*   **Surveillance and Verification:** Reopening depends on Mexico's ability to conduct intensive surveillance and provide transparent, verifiable data showing a sustained period (likely 90+ days) with no new NWS detections. (Moderate)
*   **Economic Pressure:** The U.S. cattle feeding industry and Mexican cattle exporters exert significant pressure for reopening. This ensures high-level political attention but cannot override the scientific/risk assessment. (Moderate)
*   **U.S.-Mexico Diplomatic Cooperation:** The health of the bilateral relationship and the effectiveness of the joint COMEXA program are crucial for efficient information sharing and operational coordination. (Moderate)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Exceptional Institutional Capacity:** Unlike a novel disease outbreak with a new trading partner, the U.S. and Mexico have a multi-decade, successful joint program (COMEXA) specifically for this type of threat. This is a major structural advantage.
*   **Proven Eradication Technology:** This is not a search for a cure. The Sterile Insect Technique is a well-understood and highly effective tool against NWS that has been used to eradicate it from North and Central America.
*   **High Degree of Economic Interdependence:** The scale of the live cattle trade between the U.S. and Mexico is immense (1-2 million head/year), creating much stronger and more organized economic pressure for a swift resolution than in many other animal health trade disputes.
*   **Failed Reopening Attempt:** The July 7-9 reopening and immediate closure is unusual. It demonstrates both a willingness to reopen quickly *and* an extremely low threshold for shutting down again, creating significant uncertainty.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start from the narrow reference class (pest ban with cooperation), suggesting a ~65% chance of resolution within 8 months. Given we are already 6 months into the ban, a prior of **~50%** for resolution in the next 50 days seems plausible.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↓↓ Large) The failed reopening on July 9 is powerful evidence that the underlying biological problem was not solved and that the USDA's trigger for closure is very sensitive. This strongly suggests a longer timeline is needed to build confidence.
    *   (↑ Moderate) The long-standing, world-class U.S.-Mexico cooperative framework (COMEXA) and proven SIT technology are strong structural positives that favor an effective, if not immediate, resolution.
    *   (↑ Small) Secretary Rollins' positive but non-committal statements in November suggest progress is being made, but they lack any concrete timeline and are weak evidence for a resolution within the next 50 days.
    *   (↓ Small) The simple passage of time. Every day that passes without a reopening makes a pre-2026 resolution less likely. We are already at the 6-month mark, which is a typical duration for such events.
*   **Net effect:** The powerful negative signal from the July failure significantly outweighs the weak positive signal from the November diplomatic meeting. The strong structural factors are already incorporated into the prior. The posterior should be revised **downward significantly** from the initial 50% prior.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Official announcement by Mexico's agriculture ministry (SADER) of a specific border region achieving 90+ days without a new NWS detection.
    *   Reports of a USDA/APHIS technical team conducting a verification visit to Mexico.
    *   Joint press release from USDA and SADER announcing a phased reopening plan or specific timeline.
    *   Lobbying groups (e.g., National Cattlemen's Beef Association) issuing statements of confidence in Mexico's progress.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Any media or official report of a new NWS case detected in a northern Mexican state (e.g., Sonora, Chihuahua, Coahuila).
    *   Statements from U.S. officials expressing continued concern or lack of confidence in Mexican data.
    *   Reports of logistical or political friction within the joint COMEXA program.
    *   Silence from both governments through early December.

To forecast the probability of the United States reopening cattle imports from Mexico before 2026, we will follow the structured Bayesian reasoning process:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - **Narrow Class:** U.S. Pest-Related Import Bans with Pre-existing Cooperative Eradication Programs. Given the historical context and the cooperative framework (COMEXA), the base rate for resolution within 8 months is estimated at 60-70%. Since we are already 6 months into the ban, a prior of approximately 50% for resolution in the next 50 days seems reasonable.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - **Similarities:** The U.S. and Mexico have a strong cooperative framework and a proven eradication method (SIT), which aligns with the reference class.
   - **Differences:** The failed reopening attempt in July indicates a very low risk tolerance and suggests that the situation may require more time than typical cases in the reference class.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Failed Reopening (July 9):** Strong evidence against a quick resolution. The likelihood of this event if the border were to reopen soon is low, suggesting a longer timeline is needed. (Likelihood ratio significantly < 1)
   - **Positive Statements (November 4):** Weak evidence for reopening. While the tone is positive, the lack of a timeline reduces its impact. (Likelihood ratio slightly > 1)
   - **Cooperative Framework and SIT:** Strong structural positives, but already factored into the prior. (Neutral impact on likelihood ratio)

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - **Prior Odds:** 1:1 (50% probability)
   - **Likelihood Ratio:** The negative impact of the failed reopening outweighs the weak positive signals, suggesting a downward adjustment.
   - **Posterior Odds:** Adjusting for the strong negative signal, the posterior probability is revised downward significantly from the initial 50%.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - **Overconfidence Check:** The failed reopening is a critical piece of evidence that suggests caution. The structural positives are already incorporated into the prior, so overconfidence in a quick resolution should be avoided.
   - **Alternative Scenarios:** Consider the possibility of new NWS detections or political/logistical issues within COMEXA, which could further delay reopening.
   - **Adjustment:** Given the strong negative evidence, the probability should be adjusted downward to account for these risks.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Based on the analysis, the probability of the U.S. reopening cattle imports from Mexico before 2026 is adjusted to reflect the significant negative evidence from the failed reopening and the cautious stance of the USDA.

Final: 25%

# Will the United States reopen cattle imports from Mexico before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll identify an appropriate reference class for this event: U.S. animal health-related import suspensions with pre-existing cooperative eradication programs.

The research report indicates that for pest-related import bans where the U.S. and Mexico have established cooperative frameworks (like COMEXA) and proven methods (like the Sterile Insect Technique), the typical duration is 3-9 months. The base rate for resolution within 8 months in this class is estimated at 60-70%.

However, we need to adjust this because:
- We're already 6 months into the ban (May 11 to November 11, 2025)
- We have only ~50 days remaining until the end of 2025
- There was a failed reopening attempt in July

Given these factors, I'll start with a prior of **50%** - reflecting that while the typical timeframe suggests resolution within 8 months, we're already deep into that window with limited time remaining.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- The U.S. and Mexico have a long-standing joint commission (COMEXA) specifically designed for these situations
- The Sterile Insect Technique is a proven method for NWS eradication
- There's significant economic pressure to resume trade (1-2 million cattle/year)
- High-level political attention is being given to the issue

**Key differences:**
- The failed July reopening attempt (July 7-9) demonstrates both willingness to reopen quickly AND an extremely low threshold for reimposing the ban
- Secretary Rollins' November 4 statement indicates progress but explicitly states they are "not ready" to lift the ban
- We're already 6 months into the ban with only ~50 days remaining in 2025

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence 1: Failed July reopening attempt**
- P(Failed reopening | Will reopen by 2026): Moderate-low. If the U.S. is going to reopen by 2026, the July failure suggests they'll need substantial time to verify eradication.
- P(Failed reopening | Won't reopen by 2026): High. The quick reimposition shows extremely low risk tolerance.
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.5 (evidence against reopening by 2026)

**Evidence 2: Secretary Rollins' November statement**
- P(Positive but non-committal statement | Will reopen by 2026): Moderate-high. This is consistent with progress toward reopening.
- P(Positive but non-committal statement | Won't reopen by 2026): Moderate. Such statements could also be diplomatic even if reopening isn't imminent.
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.5 (weak evidence for reopening by 2026)

**Evidence 3: Established institutional framework (COMEXA)**
- P(Strong framework exists | Will reopen by 2026): Very high. This is necessary for quick resolution.
- P(Strong framework exists | Won't reopen by 2026): High. Even with good frameworks, some issues take longer.
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.2 (slight evidence for reopening by 2026)

**Evidence 4: Time already elapsed (6 months)**
- P(6 months elapsed | Will reopen by 2026): Moderate. This is within but approaching the upper end of the typical timeframe.
- P(6 months elapsed | Won't reopen by 2026): High. Longer durations correlate with longer total ban periods.
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.7 (evidence against reopening by 2026)

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)

Starting with prior odds of 50:50 (1:1)

Update on failed July reopening:
- Posterior odds = 1 × 0.5 = 0.5
- Posterior probability = 0.5/(1+0.5) = 33%

Update on Secretary Rollins' statement:
- Posterior odds = 0.5 × 1.5 = 0.75
- Posterior probability = 0.75/(1+0.75) = 43%

Update on institutional framework:
- Posterior odds = 0.75 × 1.2 = 0.9
- Posterior probability = 0.9/(1+0.9) = 47%

Update on time elapsed:
- Posterior odds = 0.9 × 0.7 = 0.63
- Posterior probability = 0.63/(1+0.63) = 39%

The combined evidence suggests a posterior probability of approximately 39% that the U.S. will reopen cattle imports from Mexico before 2026.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the economic and political pressure to reopen the border. The cattle industry is powerful, and with only 50 days left in 2025, there could be intense lobbying.
- I might be overweighting the July failure. If significant progress has been made since then in controlling NWS, the USDA might be more confident now.
- The research doesn't specify the exact biological timeline for confirming NWS eradication. If the standard is 90+ days without detection, and Mexico has already achieved this in key regions, reopening could happen quickly.

**Alternative forecast:**
A more optimistic view might put the probability at 55-60%, arguing that:
- The positive tone from Secretary Rollins suggests significant progress
- The economic importance of the cattle trade creates strong incentives to resolve quickly
- The established institutional framework means technical solutions can be implemented rapidly once conditions are met

**Rebuttal:**
While these points have merit, the USDA's demonstrated extreme caution (July 9 reimposition) and explicit November statement that they're "not ready" strongly suggest they won't rush. With only 50 days remaining and no announced timeline, the window is narrowing rapidly.

After considering these perspectives, I'll adjust my forecast slightly upward to 42% to account for the possibility of accelerated political pressure as the year-end approaches.

## 6. Final Forecast

Final: 42%

Here is a careful probabilistic forecast.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most appropriate reference class is not all U.S. animal health import bans, but a narrower one: **U.S. pest-related import bans where a pre-existing cooperative eradication program exists.** The research report notes that these bans are typically resolved within 3-9 months. The current ban began on May 11, 2025. The question asks about resolution before January 1, 2026, which is a total duration of about 7.5 months. This timeframe falls squarely within the 3-9 month range.

However, we are forecasting on November 11, 2025, six months into the ban. The fact that it hasn't been resolved yet is itself evidence. A reasonable prior, as suggested in the research brief, is the conditional probability of the ban being lifted in the next 50 days, given it has already lasted 6 months. This suggests a starting point lower than the initial 60-70% chance of resolution within 8 months. I will set the prior at **50%**, representing an even chance that the resolution will occur in the next ~50 days versus sometime after.

Prior Odds: 1:1

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
**Similarities:** The current situation fits the narrow reference class well. It involves a known pest (NWS), a proven eradication method (Sterile Insect Technique), and a long-standing cooperative framework (COMEXA).

**Differences:**
*   **Positive Difference:** The institutional capacity and economic interdependence are described as "exceptional." The U.S.-Mexico COMEXA program is a world-class example of cross-border cooperation on animal health, and the sheer volume of trade (~1 million+ cattle/year) creates immense economic pressure for a swift resolution. These factors would argue for a faster-than-average resolution.
*   **Negative Difference:** The most significant unusual factor is the failed reopening attempt on July 7-9. This is a powerful signal that the biological problem on the ground was not contained, and it demonstrates the USDA's extremely low tolerance for risk, which will likely lead to a more stringent and lengthy verification process than might otherwise be expected.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will evaluate the key evidence against the 50% prior.

*   **Evidence 1: The failed reopening on July 9.** A new NWS case was detected, forcing the immediate re-imposition of the ban.
    *   P(E | H): How likely is a failed reopening if the ban is ultimately lifted before 2026? It's possible, but it implies a serious setback that must be overcome very quickly. It would require an extremely effective response to get back on track within the tight timeframe.
    *   P(E | ~H): How likely is a failed reopening if the ban extends into 2026? Very likely. A failed reopening is a primary cause for a prolonged ban, as it resets the surveillance clock and erodes confidence. International standards often require a 90-day period *after the last detection* to declare an area pest-free. A detection in early July means a 90-day clock would have expired only in early October, leaving a very tight window for verification and administrative action before year-end.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** P(E|H)/P(E|~H) is significantly less than 1. This evidence strongly **decreases** the probability of a pre-2026 reopening.

*   **Evidence 2: USDA Secretary's statement on November 4.** Secretary Rollins was "pleased with Mexico's efforts" but gave "no time frame" for reopening.
    *   P(E | H): If a reopening is planned for the next 50 days, this kind of cautious, non-committal but positive statement is plausible. It manages expectations while signaling progress.
    *   P(E | ~H): If a reopening is *not* planned for the next 50 days, this is also a very plausible diplomatic holding statement. It acknowledges Mexico's work to appease economic stakeholders without making any firm commitment.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Close to 1. This is very weak evidence. The positive tone is slightly encouraging, but the lack of a timeline cancels it out. The net effect is negligible.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
*   **Prior Odds:** 1:1 (50% probability).
*   **Update with Evidence 1 (Failed Reopening):** This is the most crucial piece of evidence. The "resetting of the clock" makes a resolution within the next 50 days much less likely. I estimate this evidence is about 3 times more likely if the ban extends past 2025 than if it is resolved before then (Likelihood Ratio ≈ 1/3).
    *   Posterior Odds = Prior Odds × Likelihood Ratio
    *   Posterior Odds = 1 × (1/3) = 1/3
*   **Converting to Probability:**
    *   Posterior Probability = Odds / (1 + Odds) = (1/3) / (1 + 1/3) = (1/3) / (4/3) = 1/4 = **25%**.

The weak evidence from the Secretary's statement does not meaningfully alter this updated probability. The posterior probability is now centered around 25%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast of 25% could be wrong for several reasons.

*   **Argument for a Higher Probability (>25%):** I might be underestimating the sheer force of the economic pressure from the U.S. cattle industry. This pressure could lead to the USDA expediting its verification process or accepting a slightly lower standard of evidence from Mexico, especially with the holiday season approaching. The July 7 attempt, though failed, showed a clear *intent* to reopen quickly. Perhaps the response to the July 9 case was so overwhelmingly effective that the 90-day clock is not a concern. An alternative forecast of 40% would be plausible if one believes economic drivers can significantly shorten bureaucratic and scientific timelines.

*   **Argument for a Lower Probability (<25%):** I might be underestimating the USDA's risk aversion and bureaucratic inertia. The political and economic cost of a screwworm re-infestation in the U.S. would be catastrophic, far outweighing the cost of a continued ban. The July 9 reversal is a testament to this. Furthermore, the remaining 50-day window includes the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays, periods when government administrative processes typically slow down. Getting the final verification, rule-making, and public announcement done during this period is a significant challenge. This line of reasoning suggests my 25% might even be too optimistic.

*   **Conclusion:** The arguments for a lower probability seem more compelling. The combination of a reset surveillance clock, the USDA's demonstrated low risk tolerance, and the holiday season slowdown are formidable obstacles. I will stick with my forecast, as it already reflects a significant downward revision from the prior.

### 6. Final Forecast
The base rate for this type of event suggests a resolution within 3-9 months. While we are within that window, the failed reopening in July was a major setback that likely reset the 90-day surveillance clock required to prove eradication. This makes a resolution in the final 50 days of the year, a period that includes major holidays, challenging. The USDA's demonstrated zero-risk tolerance will almost certainly override economic pressure until they have completely verified, incontrovertible data from Mexico, a process that takes time. The positive diplomatic language is weak evidence against these hard constraints.

Final: 25%
