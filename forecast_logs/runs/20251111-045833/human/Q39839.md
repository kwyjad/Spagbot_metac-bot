### Reference class & base rates
1.  **SpaceX Falcon 9 Early Landing Attempts (2013-2015):** This is the strongest reference class. It involves the first attempts to propulsively land a large, orbital-class, liquid-fueled first stage on a sea-based platform. SpaceX experienced multiple failures before its first success.
    *   **Base Rate:** Low. SpaceX's first successful booster landing occurred on its 20th flight (first sea landing on the 23rd). Looking only at dedicated landing attempts, success came after at least 4-5 explicit failures or hard water landings. The success rate for a *second* landing attempt is effectively 0%. A generous base rate for success within the first 3-4 attempts might be **15-25%**.
    *   **Limitations:** Blue Origin has had the benefit of observing SpaceX's successes and failures for a decade, potentially allowing them to bypass some early learning curve issues.
2.  **Inaugural Flights of New Heavy-Lift Launch Vehicles:** This class considers the success of major secondary objectives (like a complex landing maneuver) on the second-ever flight of a new rocket. Historically, the focus of early flights is simply reaching orbit safely.
    *   **Base Rate:** Very Low. Achieving a complex, novel secondary objective on flight #2 is rare. Most programs focus on iterative capability demonstration. A base rate for success would be **<10%**.
    *   **Limitations:** This class is broad and doesn't account for the modern software-driven, iterative design approach pioneered by SpaceX and presumably adopted to some extent by Blue Origin.
3.  **Blue Origin New Shepard Booster Landings:** This class includes all of Blue Origin's own successful reusable rocket landings.
    *   **Base Rate:** 100% (over 20 successful landings).
    *   **Limitations:** This is a weak reference class. New Shepard is a suborbital vehicle with a much lower apogee, velocity, and thermal/aerodynamic stress profile on re-entry. While it demonstrates competence in the basic principles of propulsive landing, it is not directly comparable to the challenge of an orbital-class booster return.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-11-10** Second New Glenn launch (ESCAPADE mission) postponed to Nov 12 due to weather. — ↑ — A weather delay, rather than a technical issue, suggests the vehicle and ground systems are ready for the attempt.
*   **2025-11-09** Launch schedule confirms multiple New Glenn flights planned for 2026. — ↑ — Indicates company confidence in the vehicle architecture and a plan to ramp up operations, suggesting they expect to resolve core issues like landing soon.
*   **2025-11-06** BNN Breaking reports on the high stakes of the second launch, targeting a successful recovery. — ↔ — Confirms the company's focus and the mission's importance but does not provide new information on the likelihood of success.
*   **2025-07-11** Blue Origin states ambitious targets of 8-10 launches in 2025 and 24 in 2026. — ↓ — These targets, set mid-year, now appear highly unrealistic given only one launch has occurred by November, suggesting a potential disconnect between plans and execution capability.
*   **2025-02-17** Blue Origin announces a 10% workforce reduction to improve efficiency. — ↔/↓ — Could be a positive sign of streamlining for production, but layoffs can also disrupt teams, lower morale, and signal internal problems. The timing after the first launch is ambiguous.
*   **2025-01-16** Inaugural New Glenn flight reaches orbit, but the first-stage booster is lost on landing. — ↔ — A mixed result. Reaching orbit on a debut flight is a major success and provides invaluable data. The landing failure provides a specific, concrete problem to solve, which is better than a more systemic failure.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Analysis & Fix of NG-1 Landing Failure:** (Large) The primary driver. If Blue Origin correctly identified the root cause of the January 2025 landing failure (e.g., software error, hydraulic failure, grid fin malfunction) and implemented a robust fix, the probability of success increases dramatically. Their "cautious" culture suggests they would be thorough.
2.  **BE-4 Engine Reliability:** (Large) The seven BE-4 engines on the first stage must perform multiple burns flawlessly, including the re-entry and landing burns. The engines have a long and reportedly difficult development history. Their performance under the dynamic conditions of landing is a key variable.
3.  **Control Software & Avionics:** (Moderate) The booster's guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) system is responsible for autonomously flying back and landing on a moving target. This is an immensely complex software challenge. Lessons from NG-1 would have been fed into software updates.
4.  **Weather and Sea State:** (Moderate) High winds, precipitation, and rough seas can make a barge landing impossible, even with a perfectly functioning rocket. This is a significant source of launch day uncertainty and risk.
5.  **Corporate Philosophy ("Gradatim Ferociter"):** (Moderate) Blue Origin's "step-by-step, ferociously" motto implies a methodical, test-heavy approach. This could mean the jump in reliability from flight 1 to flight 2 is larger than it was for SpaceX, which embraced rapid, public failure as part of its process.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Learning from a Pioneer:** Unlike SpaceX (the reference class), Blue Origin is not inventing reusable rocketry from scratch. They have a decade of public Falcon 9 data, videos, and conference presentations to learn from, which should allow them to avoid certain categories of "unknown unknowns."
*   **Patient Capital:** Blue Origin is funded by Jeff Bezos's personal fortune, insulating it from the market pressures that forced early SpaceX to fly and iterate quickly to secure contracts for survival. This allows for a slower, more deliberate (and potentially more robust) development process.
*   **Engine Architecture:** New Glenn uses methalox (Methane/LOX) BE-4 engines, whereas Falcon 9 uses kerolox (RP-1/LOX) Merlin engines. Methane offers potential performance benefits but also introduces different engineering challenges (e.g., coking, relight characteristics) that are less mature than kerolox systems.
*   **Single Data Point:** The reference class is built on many SpaceX failures. Blue Origin has only one orbital landing failure. They may have learned enough from this single event to solve the problem, a different strategy than SpaceX's need for multiple data points from rapid-fire attempts.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A prior anchored to the Falcon 9 reference class seems appropriate. Given the difficulty of the task, a starting probability of **~25%** seems reasonable, with a low "equivalent n" (e.g., n=4) reflecting the limited data on second attempts.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   ↑ (Large): The "cautious" corporate culture combined with 10 months to analyze and fix the specific failure from the first flight is the strongest positive update.
    *   ↑ (Moderate): The successful orbital insertion of NG-1 proves the fundamental vehicle design is sound, isolating the problem to the landing phase.
    *   ↑ (Small): The vehicle is on the pad for an imminent attempt, with delays attributed to weather, not technical problems, indicating vehicle readiness.
    *   ↓ (Small): The long and troubled development history of the BE-4 engines remains a source of residual uncertainty about their performance in the final moments of flight.
    *   ↓ (Small): The failure to meet the ambitious 2025 launch cadence goals suggests potential execution/production challenges that could impact overall program health.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly suggests an upward revision from the low base rate. The targeted learning from the first failure is a powerful counterweight to the historical difficulty. The posterior should move significantly upward, likely into the **45-60%** range.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   A smooth countdown for the Nov 12 attempt with no technical holds.
    *   Favorable weather and sea state forecasts for the launch and recovery zones.
    *   Clear communication from Blue Origin officials expressing confidence in the specific fixes implemented post-NG-1.
    *   Successful stage separation and boostback/re-entry burn sequence reported during live telemetry.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Any further launch slip attributed to a technical issue with the rocket or ground systems.
    *   An extended hold during the countdown related to vehicle telemetry.
    *   Deteriorating weather forecasts forcing a multi-day scrub.
    *   Loss of telemetry from the booster after stage separation.
    *   If the Nov 12 attempt fails, no announcement of a rapid turnaround for another attempt before year-end.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Information Asymmetry:** Blue Origin is notoriously secretive. The public does not know the root cause of the January 2025 landing failure, making it difficult to assess if their fix is adequate. We are forecasting based on assumptions about their competence.
*   **Resolution Window:** The question is "before 2026." The Nov 12 launch is the

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The most relevant base rate comes from SpaceX's early attempts at landing the Falcon 9 booster on a sea-based platform. SpaceX's first successful sea landing occurred after several failures, suggesting a low initial success rate for early attempts. A generous base rate for success within the first 3-4 attempts might be **15-25%**. Given Blue Origin's cautious approach and the ability to learn from SpaceX's experiences, I will start with a prior probability of **25%**.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: Both involve landing a large, orbital-class booster on a sea-based platform. Blue Origin, like SpaceX, is attempting a complex maneuver that has historically been challenging.
   - Differences: Blue Origin has the advantage of learning from SpaceX's decade of experience, potentially allowing them to avoid some early pitfalls. However, Blue Origin's cautious approach means they have less iterative experience compared to SpaceX's rapid testing and learning cycle.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Cautious Culture and Time for Analysis**: Blue Origin's methodical approach and the time taken to analyze the first failure suggest a thorough understanding and potential fix, increasing the likelihood of success. This evidence increases the probability.
   - **Successful Orbital Insertion**: The successful orbital insertion of NG-1 indicates the vehicle's fundamental design is sound, isolating the problem to the landing phase. This evidence slightly increases the probability.
   - **BE-4 Engine Reliability**: The BE-4 engines have a troubled development history, introducing uncertainty about their performance during landing. This evidence slightly decreases the probability.
   - **Launch Schedule and Delays**: The ambitious launch schedule and subsequent delays suggest potential execution challenges, slightly decreasing the probability.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Prior odds = 25% / 75% = 1/3
   - Considering the evidence, particularly the cautious culture and successful orbital insertion, the likelihood ratio is greater than 1, suggesting an increase in probability.
   - Posterior odds = Prior odds × Likelihood ratio ≈ (1/3) × 2 = 2/3
   - Posterior probability = (2/3) / (1 + 2/3) ≈ 40%

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence Risk: The cautious approach may not fully compensate for the lack of iterative testing experience. The BE-4 engine's reliability remains a significant risk.
   - Alternative Scenario: If the BE-4 engines perform flawlessly and the landing software has been adequately updated, the probability could be higher. However, the historical difficulty of such landings tempers this optimism.
   - Adjustments: Given the potential for unforeseen technical challenges, a slight downward adjustment is prudent.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Considering the base rate, evidence, and potential risks, the final calibrated probability is:
   
Final: 38%

# Forecasting Blue Origin's "Never Tell Me The Odds" Landing Success Before 2026

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this forecast, I'll use SpaceX's Falcon 9 early landing attempts as the primary reference class, as it represents the most similar technological challenge - landing an orbital-class first stage booster on a sea platform.

**Base Rate:** 25%

This is derived from SpaceX's experience, where:
- Their first successful landing came after multiple failures
- Looking specifically at second landing attempts following a first failure, the success rate was effectively 0%
- However, Blue Origin has had the benefit of observing SpaceX's decade of experience

I'm selecting a somewhat generous 25% as the prior probability, acknowledging that Blue Origin has advantages SpaceX didn't have during their pioneering attempts, but still recognizing the inherent difficulty of the task.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Both involve landing a large orbital-class first stage on a sea platform
- Both face similar physics challenges (supersonic reentry, precision targeting, final landing burn)
- Both companies are private entities with significant resources

**Key differences:**
- Blue Origin has had the benefit of observing SpaceX's successes and failures for a decade
- Blue Origin has a more methodical, cautious development approach ("Gradatim Ferociter")
- Blue Origin has already collected data from their first landing attempt failure in January 2025
- Blue Origin has had 10 months to analyze and fix the specific issues from the first attempt
- Blue Origin uses methalox BE-4 engines vs. SpaceX's kerolox Merlin engines

These differences suggest a potential upward adjustment from the base rate, as Blue Origin has significant advantages that SpaceX didn't have during their early attempts.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: First New Glenn flight reached orbit successfully (January 2025)**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.95) - A successful landing would almost certainly be preceded by successful orbit
- P(E|~H): Moderate-high (~0.7) - Even with a landing failure, orbit success is still likely
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.36
- Direction: Moderately increases probability
- This demonstrates fundamental vehicle design soundness, isolating problems to just the landing phase

**Evidence 2: 10 months to analyze and fix the specific landing failure**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.9) - Success would likely follow a thorough analysis and fix period
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.5) - Even with analysis time, complex problems may persist
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.8
- Direction: Significantly increases probability
- Blue Origin's cautious culture suggests they would be thorough in addressing the specific failure mode

**Evidence 3: Second launch ready to go with weather (not technical) delays**
- P(E|H): High (~0.8) - A vehicle ready for launch with no technical holds is more likely to succeed
- P(E|~H): Moderate-high (~0.6) - Even launch-ready vehicles can fail during landing
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.33
- Direction: Moderately increases probability
- Suggests confidence in the vehicle and fixes implemented

**Evidence 4: Missed 2025 launch cadence targets**
- P(E|H): Low-moderate (~0.4) - Success could still occur despite organizational execution issues
- P(E|~H): Moderate-high (~0.7) - Execution problems correlate with technical challenges
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.57
- Direction: Moderately decreases probability
- Suggests potential organizational execution challenges that could impact overall program health

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 25:75 (or 1:3):

**Update on Evidence 1 (Successful orbit on first flight):**
- Prior odds: 1:3
- Likelihood ratio: 1.36
- Posterior odds: 1.36:3 = 0.453:1
- Posterior probability: 0.453/(1+0.453) ≈ 31.2%

**Update on Evidence 2 (10 months to analyze and fix):**
- Prior odds: 0.453:1
- Likelihood ratio: 1.8
- Posterior odds: 0.815:1
- Posterior probability: 0.815/(1+0.815) ≈ 44.9%

**Update on Evidence 3 (Launch ready with only weather delays):**
- Prior odds: 0.815:1
- Likelihood ratio: 1.33
- Posterior odds: 1.084:1
- Posterior probability: 1.084/(1+1.084) ≈ 52.0%

**Update on Evidence 4 (Missed launch cadence targets):**
- Prior odds: 1.084:1
- Likelihood ratio: 0.57
- Posterior odds: 0.618:1
- Posterior probability: 0.618/(1+0.618) ≈ 38.2%

However, I believe this underweights the significance of Blue Origin's methodical approach and the time they've had to fix the specific issue. Making a holistic adjustment:

**Adjusted posterior probability: ~48%**

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overestimating Blue Origin's ability to learn from SpaceX's experience
- The BE-4 engine's reliability during the complex landing sequence remains uncertain
- Weather and sea conditions could be worse than anticipated for the November launch
- There may be unknown failure modes that weren't revealed in the first landing attempt
- Blue Origin's secretive nature means we lack detailed information about the January failure

**Alternative forecast:**
A more pessimistic view would place the probability closer to 30%, arguing that:
- Landing an orbital-class booster is inherently difficult regardless of preparation
- Blue Origin's slow development pace suggests deeper technical challenges
- The first landing failure might indicate fundamental design issues that can't be quickly resolved

**Rebuttal:**
- Blue Origin's methodical approach, while slower, may produce more robust solutions
- They have had a full 10 months to address a specific, known failure mode
- The successful orbital insertion on the first attempt demonstrates fundamental vehicle soundness

After considering these points, I'll adjust my forecast slightly downward to account for the inherent difficulty and uncertainty:

**Final adjusted probability: 45%**

## 6. Final Forecast

Final: 45%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The event in question is the successful propulsive landing of an orbital-class first-stage booster on its second-ever attempt. The most appropriate reference class is the early landing attempts of the SpaceX Falcon 9, as it is the only other program to have accomplished this feat.

- **Reference Class:** SpaceX Falcon 9 early sea-based landing attempts (2014-2016).
- **Data:** SpaceX's first successful sea landing occurred on its 5th attempt on a drone ship (and after several preceding "soft water landing" tests). The success rate for the *second* attempt was 0%. The success rate within the first four attempts was 0%.
- **Base Rate (Prior):** A strict reading of the second-attempt data would give a 0% base rate, which is too extreme. A more reasonable approach is to estimate the probability of success for any given early attempt. Given that success took approximately 5-6 dedicated attempts, a base rate `p` can be estimated as `1/k`, or roughly 1/5 to 1/6. This suggests a prior probability of **20%**. This acknowledges the extreme difficulty of the task as demonstrated by the only historical precedent.
- **Prior Odds:** P(H) = 0.20, P(~H) = 0.80. Prior Odds = 0.20 / 0.80 = **1:4**.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** The core engineering challenge is nearly identical: propulsively landing a large, liquid-fueled orbital-class booster on a moving sea platform.
- **Differences:**
    - **Learning Advantage:** Unlike SpaceX, which was pioneering this capability, Blue Origin has had over a decade to observe SpaceX's successes and failures. They can learn from publicly available data, avoiding entire classes of mistakes that SpaceX had to discover through trial and error (e.g., issues with grid fin hydraulic fluid, engine throttle range, landing leg design). This is a significant advantage.
    - **Corporate Philosophy:** Blue Origin's "Gradatim Ferociter" (step-by-step, ferociously) culture is methodical and cautious, in contrast to SpaceX's rapid iterative approach. This means they had ~10 months between the first and second flights to meticulously analyze the landing failure and implement a robust fix. This could lead to a much larger reliability improvement between flight 1 and 2 than was seen with SpaceX.
    - **Technical Differences:** New Glenn uses methalox BE-4 engines, which have different performance and relight characteristics than Falcon 9's kerolox Merlin engines. The BE-4 has a long and reportedly troubled development history, which adds a layer of specific technical uncertainty.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
Let H be the event "Successful launch and landing before 2026".

- **Evidence 1: Successful orbital insertion on the first flight (NG-1).**
    - This is strong positive evidence. It proves the fundamental rocket design, engine performance during ascent, and stage separation are sound. It isolates the problem to the landing phase, providing a clear focus for engineering efforts and a wealth of data from the failed attempt.
    - P(E1 | H) > P(E1 | ~H). The likelihood ratio is moderately greater than 1. This increases the probability.

- **Evidence 2: 10-month gap for analysis and correction.**
    - This is consistent with Blue Origin's cautious culture. It suggests they are not rushing, but instead taking the time to understand the root cause of the NG-1 landing failure and implement a high-confidence fix.
    - P(E2 | H) > P(E2 | ~H). This is positive evidence, suggesting a higher-than-average jump in reliability for the second attempt. Likelihood ratio is greater than 1.

- **Evidence 3: Unrealistic 2025 launch cadence targets.**
    - Blue Origin stated ambitious goals of 8-10 launches in 2025 but will have flown at most two. This suggests a disconnect between planning and execution capability, which can be a symptom of deeper organizational or production issues.
    - P(E3 | H) < P(E3 | ~H). This is negative evidence, slightly decreasing the probability of achieving a difficult technical milestone. Likelihood ratio is less than 1.

- **Evidence 4: Vehicle is on the pad for a Nov 12 attempt, with delays attributed to weather.**
    - This indicates the vehicle and ground systems are believed to be ready. The absence of technical scrubs is a positive sign of vehicle health and team confidence.
    - P(E4 | H) > P(E4 | ~H). This is weak positive evidence, confirming readiness for this specific attempt. Likelihood ratio is slightly greater than 1.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
- **Start with Prior Odds:** 1:4 (20% probability).
- **Update with Key Evidence:** The most significant factor is the combination of learning from SpaceX and having a single, specific failure from NG-1 to analyze for 10 months. This is a massive advantage over the base case. This evidence strongly suggests that Blue Origin's learning curve should be compressed, justifying a large upward update. Let's estimate this combined evidence provides a likelihood ratio of 3.0.
    - **Interim Odds:** (1:4) × 3.0 = 3:4.
    - **Interim Probability:** 3 / (3 + 4) = 3/7 ≈ 43%.
- **Incorporate other evidence:** The successful NG-1 ascent is another positive factor (LR ≈ 1.5), while the missed cadence targets are a negative one (LR ≈ 0.8).
    - **Next Odds:** (3:4) × 1.5 × 0.8 = (3:4) × 1.2 = 3.6:4 ≈ 9:10.
    - **Next Probability:** 9 / (9 + 10) = 9/19 ≈ 47%.
- **Final Nudge:** The vehicle's readiness on the pad is a final small positive indicator (LR ≈ 1.2).
    - **Posterior Odds:** (9:10) × 1.2 = 10.8:10 ≈ 11:10.
    - **Posterior Probability:** 11 / (11 + 10) = 11/21 ≈ 52%.

The analysis suggests the probability has moved from a low base rate of 20% to slightly over 50%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Potential Blind Spot:** Overestimating the value of "learning from SpaceX." Knowing the solution in principle is different from implementing it successfully on a new, unique vehicle. Blue Origin is notoriously secretive, so the public does not know the true cause of the first landing failure. If it was a fundamental issue with the BE-4 engines' relight or throttling capability, it might be much harder to fix than a simple software or hydraulic issue.
- **Alternative (Pessimistic) View:** The base rate is low for a reason: this is an incredibly hard problem. Blue Origin's slow pace and missed targets are not signs of caution, but of significant internal dysfunction. The probability should remain low, perhaps around 30-35%, reflecting that they are more likely to fail again than succeed.
- **Alternative (Optimistic) View:** A multi-billion dollar effort, with a decade of observation, a successful first launch, and 10 months to fix one known problem should have a high probability of success. They would not proceed with the launch unless they were highly confident. The probability should be higher, perhaps 65-70%.
- **Conclusion:** My estimate of ~52% sits between these views. It acknowledges the immense advantage of being a follower but respects the inherent difficulty of the task and the company's mixed track record on execution speed. The question is essentially a coin flip, but with a slight edge toward success due to the focused learning opportunity. I will adjust slightly upward to reflect a stronger weight on the "they had one job to fix in 10 months" argument.

### 6. Final Forecast
The forecast starts with a low base rate of 20%, derived from the only comparable historical example. This is then significantly updated by the massive advantage Blue Origin has in being able to learn from a decade of SpaceX's public trial and error. The successful first launch of New Glenn provides further confidence in the vehicle's core systems, allowing the company to focus exclusively on solving the landing problem. While negative indicators like missed production targets exist, they are outweighed by the focused, well-resourced effort to analyze and correct the specific failure from the first flight. The resulting probability is slightly better than a coin toss.

Final: 55%
