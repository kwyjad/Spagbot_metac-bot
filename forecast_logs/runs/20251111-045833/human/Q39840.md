### Reference class & base rates
-   **Recent Nov-Dec Periods (2020-2024):** This class captures the current high-temperature regime. Based on Copernicus data, peak daily anomalies in this period have been high. The Nov-Dec 2023 peak (during a strong El Niño) was approximately **+1.1°C to +1.2°C** above the 1991-2020 baseline. Other recent non-El Niño years saw peaks in the **+0.8°C to +1.0°C** range. This class suggests a base rate centered around **1.0°C**.
-   **La Niña Years Following Strong El Niño Events (e.g., 2010, 2016):** This class provides a better analogue for the specific climate transition. In these years, global temperatures drop from the El Niño peak but remain elevated due to residual heat and the long-term trend. The peak daily anomalies during the Nov-Dec periods of these years were lower than the preceding El Niño peak but still significantly above the long-term average. This suggests a base rate in the **+0.7°C to +1.0°C** range.
-   **Limitations:** The sample size for strong El Niño to La Niña transitions is small. More importantly, the powerful long-term warming trend (~0.2°C per decade) means that each new La Niña event occurs on a significantly warmer baseline, making direct comparison to past events challenging.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
The question is dated 2025-11-11, so the relevant recency window is the last 6 months.
-   **2025-10-16** Winter outlooks confirm La Niña's influence, but also note long-term warming trends will lead to above-normal temperatures in some regions. (↓/↑) — Confirms La Niña's cooling pressure but highlights the powerful counteracting warming trend.
-   **2025-10-09** NOAA officially confirms La Niña conditions are present and expected to persist through winter. (↓) — The primary cooling mechanism for the forecast period is now officially active, not just forecast.
-   **2025-09-XX** (Per background) Temperature anomaly growth stagnated, with 2025 year-to-date falling from 2nd to 3rd warmest. (↓) — Tangible evidence that the post-El Niño cooling is taking effect on a global scale, reducing the likelihood of reaching the extreme peaks seen in 2023/2024.
-   **2025-07-XX** (Implied by sources) The transition from El Niño to neutral conditions was completed, ending the period of maximum short-term warming pressure. (↓) — The primary driver of the record 2023-2024 heat has dissipated.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
-   **ENSO Phase (La Niña):** The primary driver. La Niña involves cooler-than-average sea surface temperatures in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific, which reduces the amount of heat transferred from the ocean to the atmosphere, exerting a global cooling effect. (Size: Large, ↓)
-   **Long-term Anthropogenic Warming Trend:** The inexorable increase in baseline temperatures due to greenhouse gas emissions. This trend "lifts the floor," making it highly probable that any given day in 2025 will be warmer than an equivalent day in a past La Niña. (Size: Large, ↑)
-   **Global Ocean Heat Content (OHC):** The oceans have absorbed over 90% of excess warming and are at record-high temperatures. This immense thermal reservoir provides a persistent source of heat to the atmosphere, buffering against La Niña's cooling and making extreme daily spikes more likely than in past eras. (Size: Moderate, ↑)
-   **Weakness of La Niña:** Multiple sources from late 2024 and 2025 describe the event as "weak" or "La Niña Lite." A weak event will have a less pronounced cooling effect than a moderate or strong one, allowing background warmth to dominate more easily. (Size: Moderate, ↑)
-   **Short-term Weather Variability:** The question resolves on a *daily* peak. This makes it sensitive to large-scale, short-duration weather patterns (e.g., a particular phase of the Arctic Oscillation) that can cause a temporary global spike, independent of the broader climate state. (Size: Moderate, ↑/↓)
-   **Stratospheric Water Vapor:** The 2022 Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai eruption injected a significant amount of water vapor (a greenhouse gas) into the stratosphere, which is expected to have a small but persistent net warming effect lasting several years, including 2025. (Size: Small, ↑)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
-   **Unprecedented Preceding Heat:** The 2023-2024 El Niño period set extreme temperature records, leaving a massive amount of residual heat in the climate system (especially the oceans) that will take time to dissipate, even under La Niña conditions.
-   **Record-High Ocean Heat Content:** The baseline OHC is substantially higher than during any previous La Niña event, providing a stronger and more persistent warming influence that counteracts the atmospheric cooling effect.
-   **Co-occurrence with Hunga Tonga After-effects:** Unlike any past La Niña, this event is occurring alongside a known, small, positive warming forcing from excess stratospheric water vapor.
-   **Accelerated Baseline Warming:** The underlying warming trend itself appears to be in a period of acceleration, meaning the "lift" from the long-term trend is stronger now than it was even 5-10 years ago during the last major cycle.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
-   **Prior:** A prior based on the reference class of recent Nov-Dec periods (2020-2024) seems appropriate, suggesting a distribution centered near **1.0°C** with moderate uncertainty (equivalent n=5).
-   **Evidence mapping:**
    -   (↓ Large) The official onset and persistence of La Niña is the strongest piece of new evidence, pushing the forecast down from the El Niño-driven peaks of 2023-24.
    -   (↑ Moderate) The La Niña is consistently forecast to be "weak," significantly mitigating its cooling potential compared to a generic La Niña event.
    -   (↑ Moderate) The immense residual heat in the system from the prior super El Niño and record OHC provides strong inertia against cooling.
    -   (↓ Small) Observed temperature stagnation in late 2025 confirms that the cooling trend is real and has already pulled anomalies off their record-setting pace.
-   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly suggests the peak will be lower than the ~1.2°C seen in Nov-Dec 2023. However, the weakness of the La Niña combined with unprecedented background heat means the cooling effect will be muted. The posterior should shift moderately downwards from the 2023 peak, but remain exceptionally high for a La Niña year, likely settling in the upper end of the historical La Niña reference class.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
-   **UP indicators:**
    -   Oceanic Niño Index (ONI) values staying weak (e.g., between -0.5°C and -0.8°C) rather than strengthening.
    -   Global sea surface temperature anomalies remaining stubbornly high, especially outside the equatorial Pacific.
    -   A persistent positive phase of the Arctic Oscillation (AO) or Antarctic Oscillation (AAO).
    -   Copernicus daily

To forecast the highest surface air temperature anomaly during November and December 2025, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate is selected from recent Nov-Dec periods (2020-2024), which capture the current high-temperature regime. The peak daily anomalies in this period have been high, with a base rate centered around **1.0°C**. This is due to the recent strong El Niño events and the ongoing long-term warming trend.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The current situation is similar to the base case in terms of the ongoing long-term warming trend and the residual heat from the recent El Niño event.
   - Differences: The presence of a La Niña event, albeit weak, introduces a cooling factor that was not present in the base case. The record-high ocean heat content and the after-effects of the Hunga Tonga eruption are also unique to the current scenario.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - La Niña conditions (↓): The onset of La Niña is expected to exert a cooling influence, making lower anomalies more likely.
   - Weak La Niña (↑): The weakness of the La Niña event reduces its cooling potential, making higher anomalies more likely than in a typical La Niña year.
   - Residual heat from El Niño and high ocean heat content (↑): These factors provide a warming influence, increasing the likelihood of higher anomalies.
   - Observed temperature stagnation (↓): The recent stagnation in temperature anomaly growth suggests a cooling trend, making lower anomalies more likely.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - Prior centered around 1.0°C.
   - Evidence suggests a downward shift due to La Niña, but the shift is moderated by the weak nature of the La Niña and the strong warming influences.
   - Posterior mean is slightly lower than the prior, with a narrower spread due to the competing influences.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence risk: The forecast might underestimate the potential for extreme daily spikes due to short-term weather variability.
   - Alternative scenario: A stronger-than-expected La Niña could lead to lower anomalies, but this is mitigated by the current weak forecast.
   - Adjustments: Consider potential tail risks and ensure the distribution accounts for both the cooling and warming influences.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Based on the analysis, the forecasted percentiles for the highest surface air temperature anomaly during November and December 2025 are:

P10: 0.8  
P20: 0.9  
P40: 1.0  
P60: 1.1  
P80: 1.2  
P90: 1.3

# Forecasting the Highest Surface Air Temperature Anomaly in Nov-Dec 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For my base rate, I'll use two reference classes:
- **Recent Nov-Dec periods (2020-2024)**: During this period, peak daily anomalies have ranged from +0.8°C to +1.2°C, with the highest (+1.1°C to +1.2°C) occurring during the 2023 El Niño.
- **La Niña years following strong El Niños**: These provide the most relevant analogue for the 2025 situation. In previous transitions (like 2010, 2016), peak anomalies were lower than during El Niño but still elevated.

Considering both reference classes and the long-term warming trend, I'll use a prior distribution centered at **+0.9°C** with a standard deviation of approximately 0.2°C, reflecting the uncertainty in how the specific conditions of 2025 will play out.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate:**
- We're in a transition from El Niño to La Niña, similar to previous ENSO cycles
- The long-term warming trend continues to influence baseline temperatures
- The seasonal pattern (Nov-Dec) matches our reference class

**Key differences:**
- The preceding 2023-2024 El Niño was exceptionally strong, leaving record ocean heat content
- The 2025 La Niña is described as "weak" in forecasts, suggesting less cooling effect
- Background warming has accelerated compared to previous La Niña periods
- The Hunga Tonga eruption's stratospheric water vapor provides an additional warming influence not present in previous cycles

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence pushing temperature anomaly lower:**
- **La Niña conditions confirmed (October 2025)**: Strong evidence (likelihood ratio ~3:1 favoring lower values) that global temperatures will be suppressed compared to El Niño periods
- **Temperature stagnation in late 2025**: Moderate evidence (likelihood ratio ~2:1 favoring lower values) that cooling effects are already manifesting
- **Transition from El Niño completed by mid-2025**: Moderate evidence (likelihood ratio ~1.5:1 favoring lower values) removing a major warming driver

**Evidence pushing temperature anomaly higher:**
- **Weak La Niña forecast**: Moderate evidence (likelihood ratio ~2:1 favoring higher values) that cooling will be less pronounced than in stronger La Niña events
- **Record ocean heat content**: Strong evidence (likelihood ratio ~3:1 favoring higher values) that there's substantial thermal inertia in the system
- **Accelerated warming trend**: Moderate evidence (likelihood ratio ~2:1 favoring higher values) that the baseline is warmer than in previous cycles

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior centered at +0.9°C, I'll update based on the strongest evidence:

**Update 1: La Niña conditions**
- Prior: centered at +0.9°C
- Evidence: La Niña confirmed (favors lower values with LR ~3:1)
- Posterior: shifts downward to approximately +0.85°C

**Update 2: Record ocean heat content**
- Prior: centered at +0.85°C
- Evidence: Record OHC (favors higher values with LR ~3:1)
- Posterior: shifts upward to approximately +0.9°C

**Update 3: Weak La Niña + Temperature stagnation**
- These effects roughly balance each other out, with the weak La Niña pushing up and the observed stagnation pushing down

The posterior distribution remains centered around +0.9°C, but with slightly reduced uncertainty as we've incorporated more evidence. The distribution is also slightly right-skewed, reflecting the potential for short-term weather patterns to cause temperature spikes.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the cooling effect of La Niña. Even weak La Niñas can significantly suppress global temperatures.
- I might be overconfident in the persistence of ocean heat. If the La Niña strengthens unexpectedly, cooling could be more pronounced.
- Short-term weather variability could produce anomalous spikes or dips that aren't captured in my reasoning.

**Alternative forecast:**
A reasonable alternative would center around +0.8°C, arguing that La Niña's cooling effect will dominate more than I've estimated. This would align with the observed temperature stagnation in late 2025.

**Rebuttal:** While plausible, this alternative doesn't sufficiently account for the unprecedented ocean heat content and the weakness of the current La Niña. The long-term warming trend is also accelerating, providing a stronger "floor" than in previous cycles.

Given these considerations, I'll widen my uncertainty bands slightly to account for these possibilities.

## 6. Final Percentiles

P10: 0.75
P20: 0.80
P40: 0.87
P60: 0.93
P80: 1.00
P90: 1.05

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The primary goal is to establish a prior distribution for the *peak daily* global surface air temperature anomaly in November-December 2025. I will synthesize two reference classes:

1.  **Recent High-Temperature Regime (2020-2024):** This period reflects the current baseline of accelerated global warming. During the Nov-Dec months of these years, peak daily anomalies have ranged from approximately +0.8°C to the El Niño-driven peak of +1.2°C in 2023. This class suggests a distribution centered near **1.0°C**.
2.  **La Niña Years Following Strong El Niños (e.g., 2010, 2016):** This class is a better analogue for the specific climate transition. However, it must be adjusted for the strong secular warming trend of ~0.2°C per decade. The peak anomaly in Nov-Dec 2016 was lower than the preceding El Niño peak. Adjusting a hypothetical +0.8°C peak from 2016 for ~9 years of warming (+0.18°C) would yield a 2025 equivalent of **~0.98°C**.

Combining these, I will establish a prior distribution centered at **1.0°C**, with a standard deviation of approximately 0.1°C. This reflects the expectation that 2025 will be cooler than the 2023 peak but still exceptionally warm due to the long-term trend.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities:** The current situation follows the classic pattern of a La Niña developing after a strong El Niño event, which typically leads to a temporary global cooling period relative to the peak.
*   **Differences:**
    *   **Unprecedented Baseline:** The 2023-2024 El Niño period set temperature records by a massive margin. This has left an enormous amount of residual heat in the climate system, particularly the oceans (record Ocean Heat Content), which will buffer against cooling.
    *   **Weak La Niña:** The emerging La Niña is consistently forecast to be weak. A weak event exerts a much smaller cooling pressure than a moderate or strong one, allowing the powerful background warming trend to play a more dominant role.
    *   **Other Warming Factors:** The lingering warming effect from the 2022 Hunga Tonga eruption's injection of stratospheric water vapor, while small, adds to the baseline warmth, a factor not present in previous cycles.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

1.  **Official La Niña Onset (↓ Large):** The confirmation of La Niña conditions is the strongest evidence for a lower peak anomaly compared to the 2023-2024 El Niño highs. This makes values above 1.15°C significantly less likely.
2.  **Forecasts of a "Weak" La Niña (↑ Moderate):** This is a critical counteracting factor. It significantly dampens the cooling effect, making a drop to the levels of past (stronger) La Niñas unlikely. This evidence increases the likelihood of values in the 0.95°C to 1.10°C range compared to values below 0.9°C.
3.  **Record Ocean Heat Content & Preceding Heat (↑ Moderate):** The thermal inertia of the oceans provides a strong "floor" for temperatures. This makes a significant drop in the global anomaly very difficult, strongly disfavoring outcomes in the lower tail of the distribution (e.g., below 0.85°C).
4.  **Observed Temperature Stagnation in late 2025 (↓ Small):** The background information confirms that the post-El Niño cooling is already underway. This provides empirical support for the La Niña cooling mechanism taking effect and reduces the probability of reaching the extreme upper tail of the distribution.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

*   **Prior:** A distribution centered at **1.0°C**.
*   **Update:** The primary evidence is a tug-of-war. The *presence* of La Niña pulls the distribution down from the 1.2°C peak of 2023. However, its *weakness*, combined with record ocean heat, pulls the distribution back up, preventing a major drop.
*   **Conceptual Update:**
    `Posterior Mean ≈ Prior (1.0°C) - Cooling (Strong La Niña effect) + Warming (Weak La Niña reality) + Warming (Ocean Heat Inertia)`
    The "Weak La Niña" and "Ocean Heat" factors largely cancel out the expected cooling from a generic La Niña event. The net effect is a posterior distribution that is only slightly lower than the prior derived from the recent (and very hot) reference period.
*   **Posterior Shape:** The median (P50) of my posterior will be slightly above 1.0°C. Because the question asks for the *highest* daily value over a 61-day period, the distribution should be right-skewed, meaning the mean will be slightly higher than the median, and the upper tail will be longer (P90-P50 > P50-P10). My final posterior median is **1.02°C**.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

*   **Alternative Scenario (Stronger Cooling):** Could the La Niña's atmospheric coupling be more effective than anticipated, or could it rapidly strengthen? Yes. In this case, the peak anomaly could fall more sharply, perhaps to around **0.85°C - 0.90°C**. This forms the lower tail of my distribution.
*   **Alternative Scenario (Warming Dominates):** Could the unprecedented ocean heat and accelerating background trend render this weak La Niña almost irrelevant for daily temperature peaks? Yes. The system could be in a new, hotter state where past analogues fail. A strong, short-lived weather pattern could push the peak to **1.15°C or higher**. This informs the upper tail of my distribution.
*   **Overconfidence Check:** The primary uncertainty is the net effect of these opposing, strong forces (La Niña vs. baseline warming). My distribution must be wide enough to capture both plausible scenarios. I have explicitly widened my tails to account for this, ensuring the P10-P90 range covers both a "more effective La Niña" and a "warming dominates" outcome. The right-skew acknowledges the "peak of many days" nature of the question.
