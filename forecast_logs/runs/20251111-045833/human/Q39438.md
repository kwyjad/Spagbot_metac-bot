### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Supreme Court Rulings on Major Executive Power Claims:** Cases where the President asserts significant, novel authority based on a broad interpretation of a statute, particularly against claims of congressional primacy (e.g., *West Virginia v. EPA*, *NFIB v. OSHA*, *Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer*). In these major showdowns, the executive branch often loses. **Base rate for executive branch loss (i.e., ruling of "unlawful"): 60-70%.** This is derived from landmark separation-of-powers cases where the Court has pushed back on expansive presidential authority.
2.  **Supreme Court Rulings After Unanimous Negative Lower Court Rulings:** The government lost in the Court of International Trade, the D.C. District Court, and the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. While the Supreme Court grants certiorari to correct errors, facing unified opposition from lower courts on a major legal question is a poor starting position for the government. **Base rate for Supreme Court affirming the lower courts' direction (i.e., ruling of "unlawful"): 70-80%.**
3.  **Supreme Court Rulings Following Oral Arguments with Widely Reported Skepticism:** News outlets and court observers across the ideological spectrum reported significant skepticism from a majority of justices toward the government's position. While not perfectly predictive, such a clear signal from oral arguments is a strong indicator of the final outcome. **Base rate for the final ruling aligning with the signaled direction from oral arguments: 85-95%.**

Limitations: Each case is unique. The foreign policy/national security context of IEEPA could grant the President more deference than in purely domestic cases, potentially lowering the "unlawful" base rate.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   [2025-11-05] Oral arguments held in the consolidated cases. ↓ Reports from multiple sources indicate a majority of justices expressed significant skepticism about the government's claim that IEEPA authorizes broad tariffs.
*   [2025-11-04] The White House partially rolled back tariffs on certain Chinese goods. ↓ This action, taken the day before oral arguments, may be interpreted as a sign of legal weakness or an attempt to moot a portion of the case, suggesting the administration anticipates an unfavorable ruling.
*   [2025-09-09] The Supreme Court granted certiorari and consolidated the cases on an expedited schedule. ↓ (for "No 2025 ruling"). This action makes a ruling before the January 1, 2026 deadline extremely likely, virtually eliminating the "No 2025 ruling" option.
*   [2025-08-29] The Federal Circuit affirmed the lower court's ruling against the tariffs in *V.O.S. Selections*. ↓ This created a powerful appellate precedent against the tariffs and solidified the legal consensus among lower courts that the President overstepped his authority.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Major Questions Doctrine (Large):** The current Court is highly skeptical of executive agencies (or the President) discovering transformative new powers in vague, longstanding statutes. The idea that IEEPA quietly delegated Congress's core tariff-setting power to the President is a textbook "major question" that the Court's conservative majority is likely to reject. This strongly favors an "unlawful" or "mixed" ruling.
2.  **Textual Interpretation of IEEPA (Large):** The core legal dispute is whether the power to "regulate... importation" includes the power to impose tariffs (a form of tax). Challengers argue tariffs are taxes, a power the Constitution explicitly grants to Congress. The government argues "regulate" is a broad term. A textualist-heavy court may find the absence of the specific word "tariff" or "duty" in IEEPA's grant of authority to be dispositive.
3.  **Nexus Between Threat and Remedy (Moderate):** The Court will assess if the tariffs "deal with" the declared emergency. The connection between tariffs on all goods from Mexico/Canada/China and drug trafficking is arguable. The link between tariffs on most global trade and "trade deficits" is even more tenuous, as trade deficits are not typically considered an "unusual and extraordinary threat." This could lead to a "Mixed ruling," striking down the reciprocal tariffs but (less likely) upholding the trafficking tariffs.
4.  **Deference to the President on National Security (Moderate):** The government's strongest argument is that the President deserves broad deference when acting under a national emergency declaration related to foreign threats. While traditionally powerful, this deference has weakened when actions have major domestic economic consequences. This is the primary driver favoring a "lawful" ruling.
5.  **Separation of Powers (Large):** Beyond the specific statute, this case implicates the fundamental constitutional allocation of power. The power "To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises" is in Article I, Section 8, belonging to Congress. The Court will be wary of blessing a massive transfer of this power to the executive branch.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Unprecedented Scope of IEEPA Use:** Historically, IEEPA has been used for targeted sanctions (e.g., freezing assets of specific entities or regimes), not for imposing broad-based import tariffs on entire economies or the majority of global trade. This novelty makes a judicial rebuke more likely.
*   **Weak Predicate for "Emergency":** While drug trafficking is a serious issue, declaring chronic "trade deficits" a national emergency under IEEPA is a legally aggressive and vulnerable assertion, unlike more traditional national security threats.
*   **Dominance of the Major Questions Doctrine:** Compared to the Court of past decades, the current 6-3 conservative majority has actively developed and deployed the Major Questions Doctrine to rein in executive power, making this a particularly bad time for the government to be advancing such a broad interpretation of its authority.
*   **Unified Opposition from Lower Courts:** It is unusual for two different federal court systems (the specialized Court of International Trade/Federal Circuit and the D.C. District Court) to both rule decisively against the executive on a major national security-related statute.
*   **Expedited Timeline:** The case's rapid ascent to the Supreme Court underscores its economic and constitutional significance, making a non-decision or procedural punt ("Other ruling") highly improbable.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Based on the reference class of major executive power claims, a reasonable prior might be: Lawful (20%), Unlawful (50%), Mixed (25%), Other/No Ruling (5%). This reflects a baseline assumption that the government is likely to lose when making novel, expansive claims of statutory authority. (Equivalent n ≈ 10).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   Unanimous reports of judicial skepticism at oral arguments: ↓↓↓ (large negative update for "Lawful").
    *   The current Court's strong adherence to the Major Questions Doctrine: ↓↓ (large negative update for "Lawful").
    *   The tenuous link between "trade deficits" and a national emergency: ↓ (moderate negative update for "Lawful," moderate positive for "Mixed").
    *   The unified and swift rulings from multiple lower courts against the government: ↓ (moderate negative update for "Lawful").
    *   The expedited schedule for review: ↓ (large negative update for "No 2025 ruling").
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly reinforces and amplifies the prior. The posterior probability for "Tariffs lawful" should decrease significantly, nearing zero. The probability should shift primarily to "Tariffs unlawful," with "Mixed ruling" as the second most likely outcome.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators (favoring "Tariffs lawful"):**
    *   Leaks from the Court suggesting conservative justices are struggling to form a majority and are concerned about limiting future presidential options.
    *   Op-eds from prominent conservative legal scholars unexpectedly defending the President's IEEPA authority on national security grounds.
    *   The administration announcing further tariff modifications, potentially mooting parts of the case and forcing a narrower, more favorable ruling.
*   **DOWN indicators (favoring "Tariffs unlawful" or "Mixed"):**
    *   Leaks from the Court indicating a large and stable majority to strike down the tariffs, with debate only over the breadth of the reasoning.
    *   Statements from administration officials or congressional allies preparing the public for an adverse ruling and outlining "Plan B" trade policies.
    *   Unusual silence from the Court as the end-of-year approaches, which could (counterintuitively) signal a deeply fractured court unable to reach a simple "lawful" decision.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Oral argument fallibility:** While a strong signal, oral arguments can be misleading. Justices may play

To forecast the Supreme Court's ruling on Trump's tariffs in 2025, we will apply Bayesian reasoning to evaluate the probabilities for each option.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Tariffs lawful**: Historically, the Supreme Court has been skeptical of broad executive power claims, especially when lower courts have unanimously ruled against the government. The base rate for the executive branch winning in such cases is low, around 20%.
- **Tariffs unlawful**: Given the historical tendency of the Supreme Court to rule against expansive interpretations of executive power, especially with unanimous lower court opposition, the base rate is high, around 60-70%.
- **Mixed ruling**: In cases involving complex statutory interpretation and multiple issues, the Court sometimes issues mixed rulings. A reasonable base rate is around 25%.
- **Other ruling**: The likelihood of a procedural outcome without a merits decision is low, given the expedited schedule and the Court's interest in resolving the issue. Base rate is around 5%.
- **No 2025 ruling**: Given the expedited schedule, the probability of no ruling by the end of 2025 is very low, near 0%.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities**: The case involves a major executive power claim with unanimous lower court opposition, aligning with historical cases where the executive branch lost.
- **Differences**: The IEEPA context involves national security, which could grant more deference to the President, but the scope of the tariffs is unprecedented.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Oral arguments skepticism**: Reports indicate significant skepticism from justices, suggesting a high likelihood of ruling against the tariffs if they are unlawful.
- **Major Questions Doctrine**: The Court's conservative majority is likely to apply this doctrine, which disfavors expansive executive interpretations.
- **Lower court rulings**: Unanimous rulings against the tariffs suggest a high likelihood of the Supreme Court affirming these decisions.
- **White House tariff rollback**: This action suggests the administration anticipates an unfavorable ruling, decreasing the likelihood of a "lawful" ruling.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)
- **Tariffs lawful**: Prior odds are low. The likelihood of skepticism and the Major Questions Doctrine further decrease this probability.
- **Tariffs unlawful**: Prior odds are high. The evidence from oral arguments and lower court rulings increases this probability.
- **Mixed ruling**: The possibility of the Court finding some tariffs lawful and others unlawful remains, but evidence strongly favors a more straightforward "unlawful" ruling.
- **Other ruling**: The expedited schedule and the Court's interest in resolving the issue make this unlikely.
- **No 2025 ruling**: Virtually eliminated by the expedited schedule.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence**: The strong evidence against a "lawful" ruling could lead to overconfidence. Consider the possibility of a mixed ruling if the Court finds some legal basis for certain tariffs.
- **Alternative scenarios**: A mixed ruling remains plausible if the Court finds a narrow legal basis for some tariffs.

### 6. Final Normalization
- Ensure probabilities sum to approximately 100%.

### 7. Output Format
Tariffs lawful: 5%  
Tariffs unlawful: 70%  
Mixed ruling: 20%  
Other ruling: 4%  
No 2025 ruling: 1%  

These probabilities reflect the strong evidence against the tariffs' legality, with some allowance for a mixed ruling or procedural outcome.

# Analysis of Supreme Court Ruling on Trump's Tariffs in 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

Looking at the reference classes provided:

- **Major Executive Power Claims**: 60-70% chance of ruling "unlawful"
- **After Unanimous Negative Lower Court Rulings**: 70-80% chance of ruling "unlawful"
- **Following Oral Arguments with Skepticism**: 85-95% chance of ruling against the government

Considering these reference classes and their relevance to this case, I'll assign the following prior probabilities:

- **Tariffs lawful**: 15%
- **Tariffs unlawful**: 65% 
- **Mixed ruling**: 15%
- **Other ruling**: 4%
- **No 2025 ruling**: 1%

This prior reflects the historical tendency of the Supreme Court to limit executive power in novel interpretations of statutes, especially when lower courts have unanimously ruled against the government.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case**:
- Involves executive branch claiming broad authority under a statute
- Multiple lower courts have ruled against the government
- Concerns separation of powers between Congress and the President

**Key differences**:
- The IEEPA context involves national security and foreign affairs, where courts traditionally grant more deference to the President
- The scope of tariffs is unprecedented under IEEPA, which has historically been used for targeted sanctions
- The "trade deficit" justification is particularly novel and tenuous as a "national emergency"
- The case is proceeding on an unusually expedited timeline

These differences generally strengthen the case for an "unlawful" ruling, with the exception of the national security context.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence 1: Oral arguments showed significant judicial skepticism**
- P(E|Tariffs lawful) = 0.05 (Very unlikely to see widespread skepticism if the Court plans to rule tariffs lawful)
- P(E|Tariffs unlawful) = 0.90 (Highly likely to see skepticism if planning to rule tariffs unlawful)
- Likelihood ratio ≈ 18:1 favoring "unlawful"

**Evidence 2: Unified opposition from lower courts**
- P(E|Tariffs lawful) = 0.20 (Uncommon for Supreme Court to reverse unanimous lower courts)
- P(E|Tariffs unlawful) = 0.80 (Common for Supreme Court to affirm unanimous lower courts)
- Likelihood ratio ≈ 4:1 favoring "unlawful"

**Evidence 3: White House partially rolled back tariffs before oral arguments**
- P(E|Tariffs lawful) = 0.30 (Less likely to see preemptive rollback if confident in legal position)
- P(E|Tariffs unlawful) = 0.70 (More likely to see preemptive rollback if expecting defeat)
- Likelihood ratio ≈ 2.3:1 favoring "unlawful"

**Evidence 4: Expedited schedule for review**
- P(E|No 2025 ruling) = 0.05 (Very unlikely to see no ruling after expedited schedule)
- P(E|Any 2025 ruling) = 0.95 (Highly likely to see ruling after expedited schedule)
- Likelihood ratio ≈ 19:1 against "No 2025 ruling"

**Evidence 5: Different legal bases for tariffs (trafficking vs. trade deficits)**
- P(E|Mixed ruling) = 0.60 (The different legal bases make a mixed ruling plausible)
- P(E|Tariffs unlawful) = 0.40 (Court might still find all tariffs unlawful despite different bases)
- Likelihood ratio ≈ 1.5:1 favoring "Mixed ruling" over complete "unlawful"

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

Starting with the prior:
- Tariffs lawful: 15%
- Tariffs unlawful: 65%
- Mixed ruling: 15%
- Other ruling: 4%
- No 2025 ruling: 1%

**Update on Evidence 1 (Oral argument skepticism)**:
For "Tariffs lawful":
- Prior odds: 15/85 = 0.176
- Likelihood ratio: 0.05/0.90 = 0.056
- Posterior odds: 0.176 × 0.056 = 0.010
- Posterior probability: 0.010/(1+0.010) ≈ 1%

For "Tariffs unlawful":
- Prior probability: 65%
- Likelihood favors this hypothesis strongly
- Posterior probability increases significantly, approximately to 85%

Adjusting other probabilities proportionally and considering Evidence 5 (which favors "Mixed ruling" over complete "unlawful"), I'll redistribute some probability from "Tariffs unlawful" to "Mixed ruling":

Intermediate posterior:
- Tariffs lawful: 1%
- Tariffs unlawful: 75%
- Mixed ruling: 20%
- Other ruling: 3%
- No 2025 ruling: 1%

**Update on Evidence 4 (Expedited schedule)**:
This strongly reduces the probability of "No 2025 ruling":

- Prior odds for "No 2025 ruling": 1/99 = 0.010
- Likelihood ratio: 0.05/0.95 = 0.053
- Posterior odds: 0.010 × 0.053 = 0.00053
- Posterior probability: 0.00053/(1+0.00053) ≈ 0.05%

Final posterior (after all evidence):
- Tariffs lawful: 1%
- Tariffs unlawful: 74%
- Mixed ruling: 23%
- Other ruling: 2%
- No 2025 ruling: 0%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots**:
- I may be underestimating the Court's deference to the President on national security matters
- The conservative majority might be more sympathetic to executive power when wielded by a Republican president
- The Court could find a narrow procedural path to avoid ruling directly on the merits

**Alternative scenarios**:
- The Court could issue a narrow ruling focused on the "trade deficit" tariffs while avoiding the more complex drug trafficking tariffs
- The Court might find the President has authority under IEEPA but that these specific tariffs exceed that authority (leading to a mixed ruling)
- The Court could remand for further proceedings on specific aspects (potentially an "Other ruling")

**Adjustments**:
- I should slightly increase "Mixed ruling" probability given the different legal bases for the tariffs
- I should slightly increase "Other ruling" to account for the Court's occasional preference for narrow decisions
- I should marginally increase "Tariffs lawful" to avoid overconfidence in a complete government loss

## 6. Final Normalization

After these adjustments:
- Tariffs lawful: 3%
- Tariffs unlawful: 70%
- Mixed ruling: 25%
- Other ruling: 2%
- No 2025 ruling: 0%

## 7. Output Format

Tariffs lawful: 3%
Tariffs unlawful: 70%
Mixed ruling: 25%
Other ruling: 2%
No 2025 ruling: 0%
(sum 100%)

Here is my probabilistic forecast based on the provided information and a structured reasoning process.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I will establish a prior probability based on a reference class of major executive power cases before the Supreme Court, particularly those involving a President claiming novel authority under a broad interpretation of a statute against a core power of Congress.

*   **Reference Class:** Landmark separation-of-powers cases where the President's authority is challenged (e.g., *Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer*, *West Virginia v. EPA*, *NFIB v. OSHA*).
*   **Base Rate:** In such major confrontations, the executive branch often loses. A reasonable base rate for the government losing (i.e., the action being ruled "unlawful" or "mixed") is approximately 70-80%. The government winning outright ("lawful") has a low base rate. The Court has also shown a tendency to seek narrower, "mixed" outcomes to avoid broad constitutional rulings.
*   **Initial Prior Distribution:**
    *   Tariffs lawful: 15%
    *   Tariffs unlawful: 55%
    *   Mixed ruling: 25%
    *   Other ruling / No 2025 ruling: 5%

This prior reflects a strong initial skepticism toward the government's position, which is typical for cases in this reference class.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities:** This case fits the reference class perfectly. It involves a President asserting a vast new power (broad tariff authority) based on an expansive reading of an existing statute (IEEPA), encroaching on a power explicitly granted to Congress (laying duties and tariffs).
*   **Differences:**
    *   **Pro-Government Difference:** The case involves national security and foreign affairs (IEEPA's purpose), an area where courts traditionally grant the President more deference. This is the government's strongest argument and slightly increases the probability of a "lawful" ruling compared to a purely domestic case.
    *   **Anti-Government Differences:** The current 6-3 conservative majority has aggressively developed and applied the "Major Questions Doctrine," which is highly skeptical of executive agencies finding transformative powers in old, vague statutes. This doctrine is a powerful tool to strike down the tariffs. Furthermore, the predicate for one set of tariffs (combating "trade deficits") is an exceptionally weak and novel justification for a "national emergency," making the government's position even more tenuous than in a typical case.

On balance, the differences, particularly the current Court's jurisprudence, make this case *weaker* for the government than the base rate scenario would suggest.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will assess key pieces of evidence and their impact on the probabilities.

*   **Evidence 1: Unanimous Lower Court Rulings Against the Tariffs.** Two separate federal court systems (the Court of International Trade/Federal Circuit and the D.C. District Court) have ruled against the government.
    *   **Likelihood Assessment:** This is much more likely to occur if the government's legal position is weak and will ultimately be deemed "unlawful" (P(E | Unlawful) is high) than if its position is strong and will be deemed "lawful" (P(E | Lawful) is very low). This evidence strongly disfavors the "Tariffs lawful" option.

*   **Evidence 2: Expedited Supreme Court Schedule.** The Court consolidated the cases and fast-tracked them for a decision in 2025.
    *   **Likelihood Assessment:** This action is extremely likely if the Court intends to issue a merits ruling in 2025. It makes the "No 2025 ruling" option highly improbable (P(E | No 2025 ruling) is very low). It also makes a procedural punt ("Other ruling") less likely, as the Court is signaling the issue's urgency.

*   **Evidence 3: Reports of "Significant Skepticism" from a Majority at Oral Arguments.**
    *   **Likelihood Assessment:** This is the single strongest piece of evidence. Such reports are very common when the Court is preparing to rule against a party (P(E | Unlawful or Mixed) is very high) and extremely rare when the Court is about to rule in that party's favor (P(E | Lawful) is extremely low). This evidence constitutes a massive update against the "Tariffs lawful" option.

*   **Evidence 4: Existence of Two Distinct Tariff Regimes (Trafficking vs. Reciprocal).**
    *   **Likelihood Assessment:** This structure makes a "Mixed ruling" a very plausible outcome. The Court could find the nexus between drug trafficking and tariffs to be legally sufficient while finding the nexus between trade deficits and tariffs to be insufficient. This evidence increases the relative probability of "Mixed ruling" compared to a simple "Unlawful" outcome.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

I will now update my priors based on the evidence.

*   **Initial Prior Odds (Lawful vs. Not Lawful):** 15:85, or roughly 1:5.6.
*   **Update with Oral Argument Evidence:** The likelihood ratio of hearing reports of widespread skepticism if the tariffs are lawful versus if they are not is very small, perhaps 1:15 or lower.
    *   Posterior Odds ≈ Prior Odds × Likelihood Ratio = (1/5.6) × (1/15) ≈ 1/84.
    *   This implies a new probability for "Lawful" of around 1/(1+84) ≈ 1.2%. This demonstrates the powerful effect of this evidence.
*   **Qualitative Updates:** The expedited schedule pushes probability away from "No 2025 ruling" and "Other ruling" and towards the merits outcomes. The unanimous lower court losses reinforce the move away from "Lawful." The two separate tariff regimes provide a clear path for a "Mixed ruling," pulling some probability away from a clean-sweep "Unlawful" ruling.

After considering all evidence, the probability for "Lawful" must be very low. The bulk of the probability should be distributed between "Unlawful" and "Mixed," with "Unlawful" being the more likely of the two given the potential for a broad ruling based on the Major Questions Doctrine.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

I must challenge my own forecast. The biggest risk is underestimating the national security deference argument. A majority of justices could decide that, despite their skepticism about the policy, it is not the Court's role to interfere with the President's declared national emergency powers in foreign commerce. This could lead to a surprise "Lawful" ruling. Another possibility is that the administration's partial rollback of tariffs is a prelude to a larger action that moots the case, making an "Other ruling" more likely than I have estimated.

To account for these risks, I will assign a slightly higher probability to "Tariffs lawful" (5%) than the strict Bayesian update suggests, acknowledging the inherent uncertainty of court predictions. I will also assign a non-trivial probability to "Other ruling" (4%). This probability is taken primarily from the "Tariffs unlawful" option, which remains the most likely outcome but should not be considered a certainty. The 65%/25% split between "Unlawful" and "Mixed" reflects the view that a broad ruling striking down the entire scheme is more probable than a split decision, but the latter remains a significant possibility.

### 6. Final Normalization

The final probabilities are adjusted to sum to 100%, reflecting the analysis above.

*   **Tariffs lawful:** 5%
*   **Tariffs unlawful:** 65%
*   **Mixed ruling:** 25%
*   **Other ruling:** 4%
*   **No 2025 ruling:** 1%

This distribution reflects a high confidence (90% combined) that the President's tariffs will be struck down in whole or in part, which is strongly supported by the available evidence.

Tariffs lawful: 5%
Tariffs unlawful: 65%
