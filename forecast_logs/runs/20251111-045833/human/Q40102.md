### Reference class & base rates
1.  **New Bilateral Migration Pilot Programs:** This is the most appropriate reference class. Such programs are often characterized by slow starts due to bureaucratic friction, legal challenges, and the need for operational coordination between two sovereign states. The base rate for the initial 3-6 months of operation is typically very low, often in the dozens or low hundreds, far below initial political ambitions.
2.  **UK Asylum/Refugee Resettlement Schemes (e.g., Syrian, Afghan):** These schemes provide a sense of the UK's administrative capacity for processing pre-vetted individuals. For example, the Syrian Vulnerable Persons Resettlement Scheme resettled over 20,000 people in five years (~4,000/year). However, this is a poor analogy because those were unilateral quota systems, not contingent "one-in, one-out" schemes dependent on returns. This class suggests an upper bound on processing capacity but is not a good predictor of the actual number for this specific agreement.
3.  **Extrapolation from Early Data:** Given the program's novelty and the short time to resolution, the most direct "base rate" is the program's own performance to date. From its operational start (first admission Sep 24) to the last data point (Oct 24), the program admitted 23 people over ~30 days, an average of ~0.77 people/day. The rate appears to be decelerating (15 people in the first 15 days, 5 in the next 15).

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-08-06** Agreement enters into force. — (↔) Sets the stage for the program but has no immediate effect on numbers.
*   **2025-09-18** First return of a migrant to France under the agreement. — (↑) Crucial proof-of-concept. The entire "one-in" part of the scheme is contingent on these "one-out" returns.
*   **2025-09-24** First 3 people admitted to the UK under the scheme. — (↑) Confirms the mechanism is functional, but the number is nominal.
*   **2025-10-09** Total admitted reaches 18 people. — (↑) Shows a flow of ~1 person/day since the first admissions, establishing an initial, slow rate.
*   **2025-10-24** Total admitted reaches 23 people; RFI reports criticism and lack of deterrent effect. — (↓) The rate of admissions slowed to ~0.33 people/day. Reports of friction and ineffectiveness suggest political or operational headwinds are building, making acceleration unlikely.
*   **2025-11-07** Home Office reiterates commitment but provides no new figures. — (↔/↓) Lack of updated, higher numbers suggests the pace has not increased. Reaffirming policy without new data often signals a lack of progress.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Rate of Successful Returns to France:** This is the primary, absolute bottleneck. No returns, no admissions. The process is legally and operationally complex, limiting throughput. (Large impact)
2.  **Administrative Processing Capacity (UK & France):** Both the return process and the subsequent visa application process for the legal route require significant bureaucratic effort. Any backlog or inefficiency on either side will slow the rate. (Moderate impact)
3.  **Political Will & Bilateral Cooperation:** The scheme's success depends on sustained high-level cooperation. Mounting criticism in either country, or bilateral diplomatic friction, could cause officials to de-prioritize or slow-walk the process. (Moderate impact)
4.  **Legal Challenges:** The return of individuals to France is vulnerable to legal challenges in UK courts. A single successful injunction could pause the entire returns process, thereby halting all new admissions under the scheme. (Large impact)
5.  **Weather and Volume of Crossings:** Poor winter weather will likely reduce the number of Channel crossings, which in turn reduces the pool of individuals eligible for return. This indirectly caps the potential scale of the program in the short term. (Small impact)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Contingent Mechanism:** Unlike standard resettlement programs (Reference Class 2), this scheme is not driven by a UK-set quota. The number of admissions is strictly tied to the number of preceding, and more difficult, returns.
*   **Pilot Phase & Short Horizon:** The program is in its infancy, a period where unforeseen problems typically throttle performance. The resolution date (end of 2025) is very close, leaving little time to overcome these initial "teething" issues.
*   **Adversarial Nature:** The program's intake is linked to a deterrent and enforcement action (returns), making it politically contentious and legally fraught in a way that purely humanitarian resettlement schemes are not.
*   **Bilateral Dependency:** The program's pace is dictated by the weaker link in the UK-France operational chain. A slowdown on one side immediately impacts the other, unlike a UK-run program where bottlenecks are internal.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A reasonable prior could be a log-normal distribution centered on a low number (~150), reflecting the tendency of such pilot programs to underperform, but with a wide tail to account for uncertainty. Equivalent n should be low (e.g., n=5) due to the lack of a strong reference class.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↓ Large) The observed rate of admissions is extremely low (<1 person/day) and has decelerated in the most recent reporting period.
    *   (↓ Moderate) The core mechanism is contingent on returns, which are known to be operationally and legally difficult, suggesting the current slow pace is not an anomaly but a feature of the system.
    *   (↓ Small) The approaching winter season will likely reduce the input (crossings), further limiting the program's potential scale before year-end.
    *   (↔) Political statements confirm intent but lack any data or commitments to suggest a significant acceleration is planned or possible in the next 50 days.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly pulls the posterior downwards. The initial slow rate is the most powerful piece of information. The posterior distribution should be heavily concentrated in the low double digits, likely below 100.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Official government announcements of a "significant" or "batch" return of migrants to France.
    *   Weekly or bi-weekly press releases from the Home Office showing a clear acceleration in the admission numbers.
    *   A joint UK-France ministerial statement praising the scheme's success and committing to a higher tempo.
    *   Reports of streamlined administrative processes being implemented.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   A high-profile court ruling in the UK that temporarily or permanently halts returns to France.
    *   Public statements from French officials expressing frustration or a desire to renegotiate the deal.
    *   A continued absence of new official figures on admissions through November and December.
    *   Media reports detailing administrative chaos or a breakdown in cooperation.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Data Lags and Lumpiness:** The numbers may be processed and/or announced in batches. The current trickle could be followed by a sudden release of a larger number (e.g., 50-100) that has been processed in the background.
*   **Political Symbolism:** The UK government may have a strong incentive to orchestrate a "symbolic" increase in numbers before the end of the year to portray the policy as a success, potentially leading to a non-linear surge.
*   **Definitional Ambiguity:** The resolution criteria is "received visas." This is precise, but reporting may conflate this with "arrivals," or other metrics. We must stick to the visa definition.
*   **Asymmetric Information:** The true operational capacity and political intent are known only to a small number of officials. Public data is sparse and likely to remain so.
*   **Deterrent Effect Fallacy:** The primary goal is deterrence. If crossings were to drop dramatically (unlikely), the number of returns and subsequent admissions would also drop, even if the mechanism was working perfectly.

### Final Research Summary
The program is a new, contingent, and bilaterally dependent pilot scheme, a class of initiatives that typically starts very slowly. The early data confirms this, showing a very low and decelerating rate of admissions, suggesting a final 2025 total in the low double-digits, likely under 75 people.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The most appropriate base rate is the performance of similar bilateral migration pilot programs, which typically start slowly due to bureaucratic and operational challenges. Historical data suggests these programs often admit numbers in the low dozens to low hundreds in their initial months. Given the current data, a reasonable base rate might center around 50-100 admissions by the end of 2025, with a wide variance to account for uncertainties.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - The current situation aligns with the base case of slow starts due to the program's novelty and operational complexity. However, it differs in that the admissions are contingent on returns, adding an additional layer of complexity and potential bottlenecks.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - The observed rate of admissions is low and decelerating, suggesting a likelihood of lower outcomes. The contingent nature of admissions on returns, which are legally and operationally challenging, further supports this. Political statements without new data suggest no imminent acceleration, reinforcing the likelihood of a lower number.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - Starting with a prior centered around 75 admissions, the evidence of slow admissions and operational challenges strongly pulls the posterior downwards. The updated distribution is likely centered around 50, with a skew towards lower numbers due to the deceleration in admissions.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Consider the possibility of a sudden political push to increase numbers for symbolic reasons, which could lead to a non-linear surge. However, given the current evidence, this scenario seems less likely. The primary risk is underestimating the potential for a sudden batch processing of admissions, but this is mitigated by the consistent slow pace observed.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Based on the analysis, the percentiles are adjusted to reflect the likelihood of low admissions, with some allowance for unexpected increases.

# Forecast: UK Admissions Under the Agreement on the Prevention of Dangerous Journeys before 2026

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this forecast, I'll use two reference classes to establish a prior:

1. **Program's own performance to date**: From September 24 to October 24, 2025, the program admitted 23 people over 30 days (0.77 people/day). The rate appears to be decelerating (15 people in first 15 days, 8 in next 15).

2. **Similar bilateral migration agreements**: Such programs typically start slowly due to bureaucratic friction, legal challenges, and coordination issues. They often admit dozens to low hundreds of people in their first 3-6 months.

Given these reference classes, I'll establish a prior centered around 50-60 people by the end of 2025, with a wide variance to reflect uncertainty. This assumes the current rate continues with some potential for modest acceleration or deceleration.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case**:
- The program is in its early implementation phase, facing typical startup challenges
- It requires bilateral cooperation between two sovereign states
- It involves complex legal and administrative processes

**Differences from base case**:
- The "one-in, one-out" contingent mechanism means admissions are strictly tied to successful returns to France
- The program faces significant political headwinds with reports that it's not deterring crossings
- The winter season (Nov-Dec) will likely reduce Channel crossings, limiting the pool of potential returnees
- The resolution date is only ~50 days away, giving little time for process improvements

These differences suggest the distribution should be shifted downward from what might be expected of a typical refugee resettlement program.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence supporting higher numbers**:
- The program has demonstrated functionality with 23 people admitted in the first month
- The UK government has political incentives to make the program appear successful
- Administrative processes might improve with experience

**Evidence supporting lower numbers**:
- The admission rate has decelerated from ~1 person/day to ~0.33 people/day
- Reports indicate the program is facing criticism and not achieving its deterrent effect
- The approaching winter will likely reduce Channel crossings
- No updated figures have been released since October 24, suggesting no acceleration
- The contingent mechanism creates a hard ceiling on admissions

The evidence strongly favors lower rather than higher numbers. I estimate the likelihood ratio for the evidence to be approximately 3:1 in favor of the lower end of my prior distribution.

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with my prior centered around 50-60 people, I'll update based on the evidence:

- The deceleration in admission rate is particularly significant. If the rate continues at 0.33 people/day for the remaining ~50 days, that would add only ~17 more people to the current 23, for a total of ~40.
- The lack of updated figures and reports of criticism suggest the program is not accelerating.
- The contingent mechanism creates a hard ceiling based on successful returns.

Applying Bayes' rule conceptually:
- Prior: centered at 50-60 people
- Likelihood: evidence favors lower numbers (3:1)
- Posterior: shifts downward to center around 35-45 people

The posterior distribution is also narrower than the prior, as the observed data provides more certainty about the program's performance.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots**:
- I may be underestimating the UK government's ability to accelerate the program for political reasons
- Data reporting might be lumpy, with batches of admissions processed at once
- The Home Office might have a backlog of cases that could be cleared before year-end
- Legal challenges could completely halt the program

**Alternative scenarios**:
- **High scenario**: The UK government prioritizes the program and streamlines processes, achieving 2-3 admissions per day in November-December, reaching 100-150 total.
- **Low scenario**: Legal challenges or diplomatic friction halts the program entirely, freezing the count at or near the current 23.

The high scenario seems less plausible given the evidence of deceleration and mounting criticism. The low scenario is a real possibility but would require a specific triggering event.

After considering these scenarios, I'll widen my distribution slightly to account for these uncertainties, particularly on the upside.

P20: 32
P40: 40
P60: 48

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most appropriate reference class is **new, bilateral pilot programs for migration management**. Such programs are often characterized by slow starts due to high levels of bureaucratic friction, the need for operational coordination between two sovereign states, and unforeseen legal or political hurdles. Unlike unilateral resettlement schemes which can be scaled by one government, these bilateral programs are constrained by the weaker link in the chain.

My prior distribution, based on this reference class, would be centered on a low number for the first 3-4 months of operation. I would set a prior median of approximately **150 people** for the period until the end of 2025, with a very wide distribution (e.g., an interquartile range from 50 to 400) to reflect the high uncertainty inherent in any new, politically sensitive international agreement.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation has features that suggest it will underperform even a typical slow-starting pilot program.

*   **Similarities**: Like other bilateral pilots, this program involves complex coordination (UK Home Office, French authorities) and is politically scrutinized.
*   **Differences**:
    *   **Contingent Mechanism**: This is the most critical difference. The number of admissions is strictly capped by the number of successful returns of migrants to France. Returns are legally and operationally far more complex and contentious than planned admissions. This creates a severe, structural bottleneck not present in most pilot programs.
    *   **Short Time Horizon**: The program began admitting people in late September 2025, and the question resolves at the end of December 2025. This leaves only about three months for the program to operate, providing very little time to overcome the inevitable "teething problems."
    *   **Adversarial Component**: The returns mechanism is an enforcement action, making it highly susceptible to legal challenges in UK courts. A single successful injunction could halt the entire process, thereby freezing admissions.

These differences strongly suggest the outcome will be on the low end of, or even below, the base rate for typical pilot programs.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
The specific data points provided are the most powerful evidence available.

*   **Initial Rate of Admissions**:
    *   Sep 24: 3 people
    *   Oct 9: 18 people total (15 people admitted in the 15 days prior, a rate of **1.0 person/day**)
    *   Oct 24: 23 people total (5 people admitted in the 15 days prior, a rate of **0.33 people/day**)
    This is the strongest piece of evidence. The rate is not only low, but it has *decelerated* significantly. This strongly pushes the forecast down, as it is highly inconsistent with a program that is scaling up.

*   **Qualitative Reports**:
    *   The RFI report (Oct 24) notes "criticism of the program is mounting" and a lack of deterrent effect. This suggests political and operational headwinds are increasing, making a rapid acceleration unlikely. This is a moderate downward update.
    *   The Home Office statement (Nov 7) provided no new figures. In politics, "no news is often bad news." The lack of a positive update on numbers suggests the slow pace has continued. This is a small downward update.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
*   **Prior**: A wide distribution centered around a median of 150.
*   **Likelihood**: The evidence (23 people in the first month, with a decelerating rate) is far more consistent with a final total under 100 than a total in the hundreds.
*   **Update**: My prior median of 150 is clearly too high in light of this strong evidence. A simple extrapolation provides a much better anchor. From the last data point (Oct 24) to the end of the year is 68 days.
    *   *Pessimistic case (recent rate)*: 23 + (68 days * 0.33/day) ≈ 45 people.
    *   *Optimistic case (initial rate)*: 23 + (68 days * 1.0/day) ≈ 91 people.
    *   *Average rate case*: The overall rate in the first month was 23 people/30 days ≈ 0.77/day. 23 + (68 days * 0.77/day) ≈ 75 people.
*   **Posterior**: The evidence pulls the distribution sharply downwards. The posterior median should lie within the 45-91 range derived from extrapolation. I will center my posterior distribution around a median of **65**, reflecting the average rate but shaded down slightly due to the recent deceleration. The variance is now much smaller than in the prior, but the distribution is skewed to the right.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
I must consider scenarios where my forecast is wrong.
*   **Upside Risk (Overconfidence in early data)**: The government has a strong political incentive to make the program appear successful. They could be working through administrative backlogs to announce a large "batch" of processed visas in December. A sudden surge to over 100 is plausible, though constrained by the returns bottleneck. My upper percentiles must account for this possibility.
*   **Downside Risk (Program Collapse)**: The returns process could be halted by a court injunction. If this happens, admissions would stop almost immediately. The final number could be very close to the last reported figure of 23, plus any processed in the interim. My lower percentiles must reflect this significant tail risk.
*   **Alternative Forecast**: An alternative view is that the initial numbers are meaningless and a politically-motivated surge will bring the total to 200+. I find this less plausible because the returns mechanism is a hard physical and legal constraint that political will cannot easily overcome on a short timescale.

My central estimate seems robust, but I will ensure my final percentiles reflect both the "program collapse" and "political surge" scenarios, creating a wider and right-skewed distribution.
