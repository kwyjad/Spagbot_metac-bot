### **Reference class & base rates**

1.  **New U.S. Unilateral Military Interventions:** The U.S. initiates overt, unilateral military action (airstrikes, raids, etc.) in a new country, particularly one that is not a declared enemy and is a regional power, very rarely. Since the end of the Cold War, such actions have been limited to states like Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Syria, and Yugoslavia, typically following extreme provocation, international coalition-building, or state collapse. Nigeria fits none of these criteria.
    *   **Base Rate:** <1% chance in any given year for a country of Nigeria's stature. This is a very low-frequency event.
2.  **U.S. Counter-Terrorism Strikes in Africa:** The U.S. has conducted numerous counter-terrorism strikes (primarily drones and special forces raids) in Africa, but almost exclusively in two contexts: a) failed or near-failed states with no effective government control (Somalia, Libya), or b) with the consent and cooperation of the host government (e.g., Niger, until recently). A strike inside Nigeria without consent would be a major departure from this precedent.
    *   **Base Rate:** Near 0% for a non-consensual strike in a stable, partnered nation.
3.  **Presidential Threats of Military Force:** U.S. Presidents often use the threat of military force as a coercive tool. The conversion rate of specific, public threats into actual kinetic action within a short timeframe is low, especially when institutional (Pentagon, State Dept.) and allied opposition is high. President Trump himself has a history of making maximalist threats (e.g., North Korea's "fire and fury") that are later used as leverage or walked back.
    *   **Base Rate:** Estimated 10-20% conversion rate from a specific, public threat of this nature to actual military action.

### **Recent developments (timeline bullets)**

*   **2025-11-02** Trump posts threat on Truth Social. — ↑ (Large) — Moves the event from a tail risk to a plausible scenario by creating a public, personal commitment to action.
*   **2025-11-01** Trump orders DoD to "prepare for possible action." — ↑ (Moderate) — Initiates the bureaucratic and logistical process, making an attack operationally feasible. This is a necessary, but not sufficient, step for action.
*   **2025-10-28** Reports of a large-scale attack on a Christian village in Plateau State, Nigeria, with over 100 casualties, receive coverage on conservative U.S. media. — ↑ (Small) — Provides the proximate cause and domestic political justification for Trump's subsequent threats.
*   **2025-09-15** U.S. State Department annual report on religious freedom again highlights severe violence against Christians in Nigeria, but stops short of recommending sanctions. — (Neutral) — Establishes the policy background but indicates the institutional preference for non-punitive measures.

### **Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)**

1.  **Presidential Personalism & Audience:** (Large ↑) The primary driver is President Trump's personal commitment. The threat is public, tied to his brand of decisive action, and plays directly to a key constituency (evangelical Christians). He may feel compelled to act to avoid looking weak or breaking a promise.
2.  **Institutional Drag & Opposition:** (Large ↓) The Pentagon and State Department will likely view a unilateral strike in Nigeria as catastrophically risky. They will fear alienating a key regional partner, destabilizing West Africa, endangering U.S. personnel and citizens in the region, and setting a dangerous precedent. They will likely slow-roll planning and present the President with high-risk, low-reward options.
3.  **A Focusing Event (Trigger):** (Large ↑) A new, highly publicized massacre of Christians in Nigeria before the end of the year could force the President's hand, overriding institutional objections. The absence of such an event allows the issue to fade.
4.  **Nigerian Government Response:** (Moderate ↓/↑) If the Nigerian government launches a credible, high-profile counter-terror operation and publicly commits to protecting all citizens, it provides Trump an "off-ramp" to claim his threat worked. Conversely, a defiant or dismissive response from Nigeria could be seen as a challenge, increasing the odds of a U.S. strike.
5.  **Operational Feasibility & Risk:** (Moderate ↓) While the U.S. has the capability (e.g., drones from regional bases, special forces), any operation carries risk. A failed raid, civilian casualties caused by a U.S. strike, or the capture of a U.S. service member would be a major political disaster. This reality will temper the appetite for action.

### **Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)**

*   **The Actor:** Unlike a typical U.S. president, Donald Trump has demonstrated a lower deference to institutional foreign policy norms, a greater willingness to use force in a personalized manner, and a high sensitivity to his political base's priorities.
*   **The Target:** Nigeria is not a typical target. It is a major regional power, Africa's most populous country, a significant oil producer, and a long-standing (if complicated) U.S. security partner. Striking Nigeria is geopolitically far more complex than striking targets in Somalia or Syria.
*   **The Justification:** The explicit "protecting Christians" rationale is unusual. While humanitarian concerns are often cited, a casus belli framed so directly along religious lines for unilateral military action is a departure from modern U.S. foreign policy.
*   **The Timeline:** The horizon is extremely short (<2 months). This compresses the decision cycle dramatically. It favors inaction, as complex military operations require time to plan, but it also increases the pressure for a rapid, symbolic strike if a trigger event occurs.

### **Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)**

*   **Prior:** Start with a very low prior (<5%) based on the reference class of new, unilateral U.S. military interventions in non-enemy states. The "equivalent n" is high, reflecting a strong belief in institutional inertia.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   ↑ (Large): The President's direct, public threat and order to the DoD fundamentally changes the calculus, making the implausible plausible.
    *   ↓ (Large): The immense institutional and geopolitical constraints associated with striking a partner and regional power like Nigeria.
    *   ↑ (Moderate): The specific appeal to a core political constituency (evangelicals) on an issue of high salience to them.
    *   ↓ (Moderate): The short timeline, which makes complex planning difficult and allows for the crisis to be overtaken by other events.
*   **Net effect:** The posterior should move significantly upward from the very low base rate. The threat is credible enough to overcome the initial near-zero probability. However, the powerful countervailing forces suggest the probability should remain well below 50%. The update is large in relative terms, but the final probability is likely still low-to-moderate.

### **Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)**

*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Pentagon press statements confirming "options are ready" or "assets are in place."
    *   Movement of U.S. ISR (intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance) assets or special operations forces to bases in neighboring countries.
    *   Another high-casualty, high-profile attack against Christians in Nigeria that receives significant U.S. media attention.
    *   Public defiance from the Nigerian government or a refusal to engage with U.S. diplomatic overtures.
    *   Further inflammatory rhetoric from President Trump on the issue.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   The Nigerian military announces a major new offensive against extremist groups in the relevant regions.
    *   U.S. officials (e.g., National Security Advisor, Secretary of State) begin emphasizing diplomatic solutions or Nigerian sovereignty.
    *   President Trump claims his threats have forced the Nigerian government to act, declaring victory without military action.
    *   A different international crisis dominates the President's attention and the news cycle.
    *   Key congressional leaders from his own party publicly express opposition to a strike.

### **Caveats & pitfalls**

*   **Defining "Attack":** The resolution criteria is broad. A single drone strike against a Boko Haram training camp would count, as would a small-scale special forces raid. The action may be limited and symbolic rather than a major intervention.
*   **Covert Action:** A U.S. attack could be covert and not publicly acknowledged. Resolution may depend on leaks or subsequent reporting, which could occur after the deadline.
*   **Information Asymmetry:** The internal White House debate, the true state of Pentagon planning, and Nigerian government intentions are all largely unknowable. Public statements may be posturing.
*   **Accidental Escalation:** An incident involving U.S. personnel already in the region (e.g., trainers, embassy guards) could escalate rapidly, bypassing the normal decision-making process.
*   **Nigerian Agency:** The Nigerian government's actions are a key variable. They could take steps that either placate or provoke the U.S. administration, significantly altering the odds.

**Final Research Summary:** The base rate for a U.S. attack on Nigeria is extremely low. However, a specific and public presidential threat, motivated by domestic politics, makes it a plausible scenario, creating a strong tension between personalized executive will and powerful institutional and geopolitical constraints.

To forecast the probability of the United States conducting a military attack within Nigeria before 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

**Base Rate:** The base rate for a new, unilateral U.S. military intervention in a non-enemy state like Nigeria is extremely low, less than 1% per year. This is based on historical data of U.S. military actions post-Cold War, which have been rare and typically involve countries with significant provocations or state collapse, neither of which applies to Nigeria.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities:** 
- Nigeria is not a declared enemy of the U.S. and is a regional power, similar to other countries where the U.S. has avoided unilateral military action.

**Differences:**
- The current situation involves a direct public threat from President Trump, which is unusual and increases the plausibility of action compared to the base case.
- The religious framing of the threat is atypical for U.S. military interventions.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

- **Trump's Public Threat:** The likelihood of a military action given Trump's public threat is higher than without it. This increases the probability significantly from the base rate.
- **Institutional Opposition:** The Pentagon and State Department's likely opposition decreases the probability, as they typically act as a check on unilateral military actions.
- **Political Constituency Pressure:** The appeal to evangelical Christians increases the probability, as it aligns with Trump's political base.
- **Operational Risks:** The high risk of failure or political fallout decreases the probability, as it would deter action.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)

**Prior Odds:** Let's start with a prior probability of 1% (odds of 1:99).

**Likelihood Ratios:**
- **Trump's Threat:** Increases odds, say by a factor of 5 (from 1:99 to 5:99).
- **Institutional Opposition:** Decreases odds, say by a factor of 0.5 (from 5:99 to 2.5:99).
- **Political Pressure:** Increases odds, say by a factor of 2 (from 2.5:99 to 5:99).
- **Operational Risks:** Decreases odds, say by a factor of 0.5 (from 5:99 to 2.5:99).

**Posterior Odds:** 2.5:99, which translates to a probability of approximately 2.5%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

- **Overconfidence Check:** The probability remains low due to significant institutional and geopolitical constraints.
- **Tail Risks:** A sudden, high-profile attack on Christians in Nigeria could force action, but this is speculative.
- **Alternative Forecast:** A forecast of 5% might be plausible if one assumes a higher impact of Trump's personalism and political pressure.

### 6. Final Forecast

After considering the base rate, evidence, and potential biases, the final forecast is:

Final: 3%

# Will the United States conduct a military attack within Nigeria before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to establish a prior probability for the U.S. conducting a military attack within Nigeria in the next ~7 weeks (from Nov 11, 2025 to Jan 1, 2026).

The most relevant reference class is "unilateral U.S. military action in a non-enemy state that is a regional power." The research report indicates this is an extremely rare event, with a base rate of <1% in any given year. Even considering the compressed timeframe (less than 2 months), this would suggest an extremely low prior.

However, given the explicit presidential threat and order to prepare for action, I should adjust this reference class to "probability of U.S. military action following a specific, public presidential threat." The research report estimates a 10-20% conversion rate from such threats to actual military action.

**Prior probability: 15%** (mid-point of the 10-20% range for presidential threats converting to action)

This prior reflects that while such military actions are rare, the explicit presidential threat significantly increases the baseline probability.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- The U.S. has military capabilities to conduct operations globally
- There is a stated humanitarian justification (protecting a vulnerable group)
- There is a terrorist/extremist presence that could be targeted

**Key differences:**
- Nigeria is a major regional power and U.S. partner, unlike typical targets like Somalia or failed states
- The justification is explicitly religious (protecting Christians), which is unusual
- The timeline is extremely compressed (less than 2 months remaining)
- President Trump has demonstrated less deference to institutional constraints than typical presidents
- The threat is highly personalized and public, creating reputational stakes

These differences suggest both upward pressure (Trump's personalism, public commitment) and downward pressure (Nigeria's status, compressed timeline) on the probability.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Trump's explicit threat on Truth Social**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.9) - If the U.S. were to attack, we would expect to see such a threat first
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.3) - Trump has made threats that didn't materialize before
- Likelihood ratio: ~3.0
- This evidence significantly increases the probability

**Evidence 2: Trump ordering DoD to "prepare for possible action"**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.95) - Military preparation is necessary for an attack
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.4) - Preparation orders can be given without follow-through
- Likelihood ratio: ~2.4
- This evidence increases the probability

**Evidence 3: Institutional resistance from Pentagon/State Department**
- P(E|H): Moderate (~0.5) - Even with an attack, we'd expect some resistance
- P(E|~H): Very high (~0.9) - Strong institutional resistance makes no attack more likely
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.56
- This evidence decreases the probability

**Evidence 4: Nigeria's status as a regional power and partner**
- P(E|H): Low (~0.2) - An attack would be unusual against such a country
- P(E|~H): High (~0.8) - This status makes non-attack more likely
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.25
- This evidence significantly decreases the probability

**Evidence 5: Compressed timeline (less than 2 months)**
- P(E|H): Moderate (~0.4) - Attacks can happen quickly, but planning takes time
- P(E|~H): High (~0.7) - Short timelines favor inaction
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.57
- This evidence moderately decreases the probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior of 15% (odds of 0.176):

First update (Trump's explicit threat):
- Prior odds: 0.176
- Likelihood ratio: 3.0
- Posterior odds: 0.176 × 3.0 = 0.528
- Posterior probability: 0.528/(1+0.528) = 34.6%

Second update (DoD preparation order):
- Prior odds: 0.528
- Likelihood ratio: 2.4
- Posterior odds: 0.528 × 2.4 = 1.267
- Posterior probability: 1.267/(1+1.267) = 55.9%

Third update (Institutional resistance):
- Prior odds: 1.267
- Likelihood ratio: 0.56
- Posterior odds: 1.267 × 0.56 = 0.710
- Posterior probability: 0.710/(1+0.710) = 41.5%

Fourth update (Nigeria's status):
- Prior odds: 0.710
- Likelihood ratio: 0.25
- Posterior odds: 0.710 × 0.25 = 0.178
- Posterior probability: 0.178/(1+0.178) = 15.1%

Fifth update (Compressed timeline):
- Prior odds: 0.178
- Likelihood ratio: 0.57
- Posterior odds: 0.178 × 0.57 = 0.101
- Posterior probability: 0.101/(1+0.101) = 9.2%

After incorporating all evidence, my posterior probability is approximately 9%.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating Trump's willingness to act unilaterally against institutional advice
- I might be overweighting historical precedent when Trump has broken norms before
- I could be underestimating the possibility of a limited, symbolic strike (e.g., single drone strike)
- I may not be accounting enough for the possibility of a major triggering event (new massacre)

**Alternative scenarios:**
- A limited, covert operation that becomes public only later
- A coordinated operation with Nigerian consent that is framed as unilateral
- A rapid escalation following an incident involving U.S. personnel already in the region

**Best alternative forecast:**
A reasonable alternative would be a higher probability (~25%) based on:
- Trump's demonstrated willingness to use force (Syria strikes)
- The political benefits with his evangelical base
- The possibility of a "surgical" strike with minimal risk

**Rebuttal to alternative:**
- Nigeria is not Syria - it's a much more significant and stable country
- The Pentagon would present extremely high-risk assessments
- The compressed timeline makes complex operations difficult
- Nigerian cooperation would be needed for effective action

Considering these factors, I will adjust my forecast slightly upward to account for the possibility of a limited strike or rapid response to a new triggering event.

## 6. Final Forecast

After considering the base rate, specific evidence, and potential blind spots, I assess that there is approximately a 12% chance that the United States will conduct a military attack within Nigeria before 2026.

This probability reflects:
- The very low base rate for such actions
- The significant but not deterministic impact of Trump's explicit threat
- The strong institutional and geopolitical constraints
- The compressed timeline
- The possibility of a limited or symbolic strike

Final: 12%

Here is my probabilistic forecast reasoning.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The event in question is a U.S. military attack in Nigeria, a country that is a major regional power and a security partner, not a declared adversary. The most appropriate reference class is new, unilateral U.S. military interventions in such countries. Historically, this is an extremely rare event. The research report suggests a base rate of less than 1% in any given year for a country of Nigeria's stature. Given the short timeframe of under two months (November 11, 2025, to January 1, 2026), the pro-rated base rate would be even lower.

I will set the initial prior probability P(H) at **0.5%**. This reflects the strong institutional and geopolitical norms that prevent the U.S. from conducting unauthorized military operations on the territory of a major partner. The prior odds are approximately 1:200 against the event.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

The current situation differs dramatically from the base case in several key ways:

*   **The Actor:** The U.S. President is Donald Trump, who has a documented history of prioritizing personal political considerations and loyalty to his base over traditional foreign policy norms and institutional advice.
*   **The Threat:** There is a direct, public, and specific threat of military action from the President. He has also reportedly ordered the Department of Defense (DoD) to prepare options. This is no longer a hypothetical risk; it is an active consideration at the highest level.
*   **The Justification:** The explicit rationale is the protection of Christians, an issue with very high salience for a core part of President Trump's political base (evangelical Christians). This provides a powerful domestic political incentive that is absent in the base case.

These differences, particularly the specific and public presidential threat, mean the base rate is no longer a sufficient guide. The situation has fundamentally changed.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

The most crucial piece of evidence is the President's public threat and his order to the DoD.

*   **Evidence (E):** President Trump publicly threatens military action against Nigeria and orders the DoD to "prepare for possible action."
*   **P(E | H):** If the U.S. were to conduct an attack (H), it is extremely likely that it would be preceded by such a public threat and order from this particular President. This is his established mode of operation. Let's estimate P(E | H) as very high, ~90%.
*   **P(E | ~H):** If the U.S. were *not* to conduct an attack (~H), how likely is this threat? Presidents often use threats as diplomatic tools without intending to act. President Trump, in particular, has a history of making maximalist threats that are not carried out. The threat itself serves a domestic political purpose. Therefore, P(E | ~H) is not negligible.
*   **Likelihood Ratio (LR = P(E | H) / P(E | ~H)):** A more direct way to assess this evidence is to use the reference class of "presidential threat conversion." The report estimates a 10-20% conversion rate. This implies that for every 1 threat that is acted upon, 4 to 9 are not. This suggests a powerful, but not definitive, likelihood ratio. If we assume P(H|E) is 15% (the midpoint), we can work backward to find the implied LR from our prior.
    *   Posterior Odds (given E) = 0.15 / 0.85 ≈ 0.176
    *   Prior Odds = 0.005 / 0.995 ≈ 0.005
    *   Implied LR = 0.176 / 0.005 ≈ 35.
    This very large likelihood ratio confirms that the threat is the single most important factor, moving the probability from nearly impossible to plausible.

Other key factors act as further evidence:
*   **Strong Institutional Opposition (↓):** The Pentagon and State Department will almost certainly oppose this action due to the immense geopolitical risk of alienating Nigeria. This is a stronger-than-average headwind compared to a typical counter-terror strike, pushing the probability down.
*   **High Salience to Political Base (↑):** The "protecting Christians" angle provides a powerful and persistent domestic political incentive for the President to act, pushing the probability up.
*   **Availability of Low-Cost Options (↑):** The definition of "attack" is broad. A single, symbolic drone strike against a Boko Haram or ISWAP target is operationally simple and carries less risk than a ground raid. This lowers the threshold for action.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)

1.  **Start with the prior:** P(H) = 0.5%.
2.  **Apply the primary evidence (the threat):** The threat is so significant that it's more practical to jump to the new reference class: "public presidential threats of this nature." This gives us a new starting point of **10-20%**.
3.  **Adjust based on specific factors:**
    *   The immense geopolitical risk and institutional opposition argue for being at the low end of this range (closer to 10%).
    *   However, the high salience of the issue to the President's base and the availability of a simple, symbolic drone strike option make this threat *more* likely to be converted than average. These factors push the probability toward the high end of the range (closer to 20%).
    *   A key variable is a potential "focusing event," like another highly publicized massacre. I estimate a 30% chance of such an event. If it occurs, I believe the probability of an attack would rise to ~45%. If it does not, the President has many "off-ramps" to claim victory without acting, and the probability of an attack would be much lower, perhaps ~8%.
    *   My blended probability is: (30% * 45%) + (70% * 8%) = 13.5% + 5.6% = **19.1%**.

This calculation suggests the final probability should be near the top of the 10-20% range derived from the threat-conversion base rate.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My forecast of 19% could be wrong for several reasons.
*   **Argument for a lower forecast (<10%):** I might be underestimating the power of institutional inertia and the allure of the "off-ramp." The threat may be pure political theater. President Trump can easily claim his tough talk scared the Nigerian government into action, achieving a political victory with zero risk. This is a very plausible and perhaps the most likely single outcome.
*   **Argument for a higher forecast (>25%):** I might be underestimating President Trump's personal commitment and willingness to override his advisors, as seen in the Soleimani strike. If he perceives defiance from Nigeria or sees a significant political opportunity, the geopolitical risks may be ignored. The broad definition of "attack" makes a low-level, symbolic strike very easy to execute.
*   **Conclusion:** The 19% forecast attempts to balance these competing, powerful forces. It acknowledges that while non-action is the most likely outcome, the specific circumstances have created a very real risk of a norm-breaking military strike.

### 6. Final Forecast

The initial base rate for such an attack is near zero. However, the direct, public threat from a President known for personalized and norm-breaking foreign policy decisions fundamentally alters the situation. This creates a strong conflict between the President's political incentives and the powerful institutional and geopolitical constraints. The high salience of the issue for his base and the availability of low-cost military options make the threat more credible than usual. While an "off-ramp" where the President declares victory without military action remains the most probable scenario, the risk of a symbolic or punitive strike is significant.

Final: 19%
