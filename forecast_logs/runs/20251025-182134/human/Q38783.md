### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Annual Churn in GiveWell's Top Charity List:** GiveWell's list of top charities changes over time. Historically (2011-2022), the list was larger (up to 10 charities). Since 2022, it has been a much smaller, more focused list of four. Looking at the last 5 years, on average 1-2 charities are added or removed each year. This suggests a **base rate of 15-25% for any given "slot" on the list changing in a year.** However, this applies to the list in general, not specifically to the re-introduction of a previously removed category.
2.  **Re-instatement of a Previously Demoted Intervention Type:** Charities or intervention types are typically removed from the top list due to declining relative cost-effectiveness or a strategic shift by GiveWell. It is rare for a demoted intervention type to return to the top list without a significant change in the evidence base or funding landscape. A plausible **base rate for a demoted intervention category returning to the top list within 3 years is low, perhaps 5-10%.**
3.  **Stability of GiveWell's Strategic Frameworks:** GiveWell occasionally makes major changes to its recommendation framework (e.g., the 2022 shift to a smaller list). These strategic shifts tend to be durable for several years. The probability of reversing such a major strategic decision within 3 years is low. This suggests a **base rate of <10% for a reversal of the "small list" strategy that led to deworming charities' removal.**

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2024-06-10** New meta-analysis published (in PMC) reaffirms positive health impacts of mass deworming. ↑ This strengthens the evidential basis for deworming, countering some long-standing critiques and potentially increasing its modeled cost-effectiveness.
*   **2025-05-01** GiveWell makes a $1.4M grant to Evidence Action's Deworm the World. ↓ This confirms GiveWell still sees deworming as a high-impact use of funds, but crucially, it does so via the "All Grants Fund," reinforcing a pathway for support *without* needing top charity status.
*   **2025-05-01** GiveWell notes it is phasing out support in Kenya (due to success) and Pakistan (borderline cost-effectiveness). ↓ This shows active management of the deworming portfolio, but also that the most cost-effective opportunities may be shrinking, making a top-charity designation less likely.
*   **2025-10-25** (Current State) GiveWell's top charities list remains unchanged since late 2022: Malaria Consortium, Against Malaria Foundation, Helen Keller International, and New Incentives. None have mass deworming as their primary intervention. ↓ The persistence of the current list demonstrates significant inertia. A change would require overcoming this status quo before year-end.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **GiveWell's Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (CEA) Model:** (Large) A significant update to the CEA—perhaps due to new evidence on long-term income effects or lower-than-expected implementation costs—could dramatically increase deworming's rank, forcing a reconsideration for the top list.
2.  **"Room for More Funding" (RfMF):** (Large) The top charity list is designed to direct marginal donations. If a deworming charity developed a large, highly cost-effective funding gap, and current top charities became saturated, GiveWell might add it to the list to absorb donor funds effectively.
3.  **GiveWell's Donor Communication Strategy:** (Moderate) The 2022 change was explicitly to simplify recommendations for donors. Re-adding a deworming charity would require reversing or complicating this strategy, which GiveWell is unlikely to do without a compelling reason.
4.  **Performance/Status of Current Top Charities:** (Moderate) If a current top charity were to falter (e.g., a negative evaluation, scandal, or fully closing its funding gap), a slot would open up. Deworming charities would be among the top contenders to fill it.
5.  **Strength of New Evidence:** (Moderate) The "worm wars" controversy has been a long-running drag on deworming's standing. A definitive, widely-accepted replication of the original Miguel-Kremer study's long-term effects could resolve the debate and elevate its status. The June 2024 meta-analysis is a step in this direction.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Reason for Removal:** Unlike most charities that are removed for declining cost-effectiveness, deworming charities were removed due to a strategic shift in how GiveWell presents its recommendations. This makes their status unique; they remain "highly recommended" but not "top." This could make a return easier than for a performance-based removal.
*   **Existence of an Alternative Funding Channel:** GiveWell's "All Grants Fund" now serves as a primary vehicle for supporting high-quality programs that aren't on the short top-charity list. This established, alternative pathway reduces the pressure to put deworming charities back on the main list.
*   **Timing:** The question resolves at the end of 2025. GiveWell typically releases its updated annual recommendations in November. We are therefore in the primary decision window for any changes to the list.
*   **Strengthening Evidence:** The base rate for a demoted intervention returning is low, but this case is unusual because the evidence base for deworming has arguably been *strengthened* in the last year, contrary to a trend of fading evidence that might normally cause a demotion.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A plausible prior, based on the low base rate of a demoted intervention category returning to the top list, would be around **10%** (equivalent n≈15, a moderately strong belief based on several years of observation).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↓ Large) The 2022 strategic shift to a small list is the dominant factor and appears stable. Inertia is very high.
    *   (↓ Moderate) The continued use of the All Grants Fund for deworming shows GiveWell has a satisfactory way to support the intervention without using a top charity slot.
    *   (↑ Moderate) The new 2024 meta-analysis strengthens the case for deworming, providing a strong rationale for re-evaluation and a potential return.
    *   (↓ Small) GiveWell is actively "graduating" some deworming programs, suggesting the portfolio of slam-dunk deworming opportunities may be shrinking, not growing.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence points downward. The structural and strategic reasons for keeping deworming charities off the main list are powerful and ongoing. While the strengthening evidence provides an upward nudge, it is likely insufficient to overcome the inertia and strategic rationale in the next two months. The posterior should move **down significantly** from the prior.

To forecast the probability of GiveWell's top charities performing mass deworming as their primary intervention by the end of 2025, we will follow the structured Bayesian reasoning process:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate for a demoted intervention category returning to the top list within 3 years is estimated to be low, around 5-10%. This is based on historical data and the rarity of such reversals without significant changes in evidence or strategy. I will use a prior probability of 10% for this analysis.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The current situation aligns with the base case in that deworming was removed due to strategic shifts rather than declining cost-effectiveness, which is typical for demotions.
   - Differences: The strengthening of evidence for deworming through a new meta-analysis and the continued support via the All Grants Fund are notable differences. However, the strategic shift to a smaller list and the existence of alternative funding channels reduce the likelihood of a return to the top list.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Strategic Shift Stability**: The 2022 shift to a smaller list is stable and shows high inertia. This decreases the probability of deworming returning to the top list. Likelihood ratio < 1.
   - **All Grants Fund**: The use of this fund for deworming indicates GiveWell's satisfaction with supporting deworming without top charity status. Likelihood ratio < 1.
   - **Strengthened Evidence**: The 2024 meta-analysis provides stronger evidence for deworming, slightly increasing the probability. Likelihood ratio > 1.
   - **Shrinking Opportunities**: The phasing out of support in some regions suggests fewer cost-effective opportunities, decreasing the probability. Likelihood ratio < 1.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Prior odds = 10% / 90% = 0.111
   - Considering the evidence, the likelihood ratios collectively suggest a downward adjustment. Assuming a net likelihood ratio of approximately 0.5 (reflecting the dominant negative evidence), the posterior odds = 0.111 × 0.5 = 0.0555.
   - Posterior probability = 0.0555 / (1 + 0.0555) ≈ 5.3%

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence Risk: The forecast might underestimate the potential impact of the strengthened evidence. However, the strategic and structural barriers are significant.
   - Alternative Scenario: A sudden, compelling new piece of evidence or a strategic shift by GiveWell could increase the probability. However, this seems unlikely given the current context.
   - Adjustments: Given the strong inertia and strategic factors, the forecast remains conservative.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - The final probability, considering both the base rate and the evidence, is approximately 5%.

Final: 5%

# Forecasting: Will any of GiveWell's top charities perform mass deworming as their primary intervention by end of 2025?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll establish a prior based on several relevant reference classes:

1. **Current status**: As of October 2025, none of GiveWell's four top charities perform mass deworming as their primary intervention. This has been the case since late 2022.

2. **Historical precedent**: Deworming charities were previously on GiveWell's top charity list for many years (until 2022) but were removed due to a strategic shift to a smaller, more focused list rather than due to a negative reassessment of deworming itself.

3. **Time horizon**: The question resolves in approximately 2 months (end of 2025), giving limited time for GiveWell to make changes to its top charity list.

4. **List update frequency**: GiveWell typically updates its top charity list annually, usually in November, which means there is likely one more update cycle before the resolution date.

Given these factors, I'll use a base rate of **15%** as my prior. This reflects:
- The low probability of reversing a major strategic decision within a 3-year timeframe
- The fact that deworming charities remain highly regarded by GiveWell (still receiving grants)
- The typical annual update cycle that provides one opportunity for change before resolution

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- GiveWell continues to use a small, focused list of top charities (4 organizations)
- The strategic rationale for the smaller list (simplicity for donors) remains in place
- Deworming continues to be supported through GiveWell's All Grants Fund, showing the organization still values the intervention

**Key differences:**
- Recent strengthening of evidence: The June 2024 meta-analysis provides stronger support for deworming's health impacts, potentially addressing some of the "worm wars" criticisms
- GiveWell is actively managing its deworming portfolio, phasing out support in some regions (Kenya due to success, Pakistan due to borderline cost-effectiveness)
- We are currently in the typical window when GiveWell would make its annual updates to the top charity list

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

Let me evaluate key pieces of evidence:

**Evidence 1: GiveWell's strategic shift to a smaller list (2022)**
- P(E|H): If deworming returns to the top list, this would represent a partial reversal of the 2022 strategic shift. Probability: 0.3
- P(E|~H): If deworming doesn't return, this is consistent with maintaining the strategic shift. Probability: 0.9
- Likelihood ratio: 0.3/0.9 = 0.33
- This evidence significantly decreases the probability of deworming returning to the top list

**Evidence 2: Continued funding through All Grants Fund ($1.4M to Evidence Action in May 2025)**
- P(E|H): If deworming returns to the top list, GiveWell would likely still fund it through other channels in the interim. Probability: 0.7
- P(E|~H): If deworming doesn't return, we'd expect continued funding through alternative channels. Probability: 0.9
- Likelihood ratio: 0.7/0.9 = 0.78
- This evidence moderately decreases the probability

**Evidence 3: New meta-analysis strengthening deworming evidence (June 2024)**
- P(E|H): If deworming returns to the top list, we'd expect stronger evidence supporting it. Probability: 0.8
- P(E|~H): If deworming doesn't return, we might still see improved evidence, but it would be insufficient to change the strategic decision. Probability: 0.4
- Likelihood ratio: 0.8/0.4 = 2.0
- This evidence moderately increases the probability

**Evidence 4: Phasing out deworming in some regions (May 2025)**
- P(E|H): If deworming returns to the top list, we'd expect robust ongoing programs with room for more funding. Probability: 0.4
- P(E|~H): If deworming doesn't return, we might see a mix of successful completions and borderline programs. Probability: 0.7
- Likelihood ratio: 0.4/0.7 = 0.57
- This evidence moderately decreases the probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior of 15% (odds of 0.176):

**Update on Evidence 1 (Strategic shift):**
- Prior odds: 0.176
- Likelihood ratio: 0.33
- Posterior odds: 0.176 × 0.33 = 0.058
- Posterior probability: 0.058/(1+0.058) = 5.5%

**Update on Evidence 2 (All Grants Fund):**
- Prior odds: 0.058
- Likelihood ratio: 0.78
- Posterior odds: 0.058 × 0.78 = 0.045
- Posterior probability: 0.045/(1+0.045) = 4.3%

**Update on Evidence 3 (New meta-analysis):**
- Prior odds: 0.045
- Likelihood ratio: 2.0
- Posterior odds: 0.045 × 2.0 = 0.090
- Posterior probability: 0.090/(1+0.090) = 8.3%

**Update on Evidence 4 (Phasing out regions):**
- Prior odds: 0.090
- Likelihood ratio: 0.57
- Posterior odds: 0.090 × 0.57 = 0.051
- Posterior probability: 0.051/(1+0.051) = 4.9%

After considering all evidence, my posterior probability is approximately 5%.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the impact of the new meta-analysis on GiveWell's cost-effectiveness calculations
- I haven't fully accounted for potential changes in the funding landscape (e.g., if current top charities become fully funded)
- GiveWell might be more responsive to new evidence than I'm assuming

**Alternative scenarios:**
- GiveWell could decide to expand its top charity list again, making room for deworming without abandoning the current four
- A current top charity could face issues requiring replacement before year-end
- The All Grants Fund approach might prove unsatisfactory for directing donor funds to deworming

**Best alternative forecast:**
A reasonable alternative forecast might be 15-20%, arguing that:
- The strengthened evidence base is more compelling than I've credited
- GiveWell has historically valued deworming highly and might return to it
- The organization might be more willing to adjust its strategic direction than I've assumed

**Rebuttal to alternative:**
While these points have merit, they don't overcome:
- The short timeframe (2 months) for making such a change
- The existence of a functioning alternative funding mechanism
- The strategic commitment to a simplified donor experience
- The active management of the deworming portfolio suggesting a transition rather than expansion

After this red-teaming, I'll adjust my forecast slightly upward to 7% to account for the possibility that I've underweighted the impact of new evidence or potential strategic shifts.

## 6. Final Forecast

Final: 7%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The event in question is whether an intervention type (mass deworming) that was removed from GiveWell's "top charities" list will be reinstated. A suitable reference class is the rate at which GiveWell changes its top charity list, specifically by re-introducing a previously removed category.

Deworming charities were removed from the top list at the end of 2022 as part of a strategic shift to a smaller, more focused list, not primarily due to a drop in perceived cost-effectiveness. Reinstating a demoted intervention category is a rare event. A plausible base rate for such a reinstatement within a 3-year timeframe is low. Based on the stability of GiveWell's strategic decisions in the past, a prior probability of **10%** seems appropriate. This acknowledges that while change is possible, it is not the default expectation. In odds, this is 1:9.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
**Similarities:**
*   Like any change to the list, reinstating deworming would require overcoming institutional inertia.
*   The strategic rationale for the 2022 change (simplifying donor choice) is still valid.

**Differences:**
*   **Reason for Removal:** Deworming's removal was strategic, not performance-based. GiveWell still considers it a highly effective intervention and funds it through other channels. This makes a return more plausible than for an intervention that was demoted due to declining evidence or cost-effectiveness.
*   **Alternative Funding Channel:** The existence of the "All Grants Fund" as a vehicle for supporting deworming reduces the *necessity* of placing it on the top list to ensure it receives funding. This makes a return less likely, as the current system is working as designed.
*   **New Evidence:** A June 2024 meta-analysis strengthened the evidence base for deworming. This is a significant positive development that is not typical for a demoted intervention, making a return more likely than the base case would suggest.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
Let H be the event that a deworming charity is on the top list at the end of 2025.

*   **Evidence 1: The 2022 strategic shift to a small list and the use of the "All Grants Fund" for deworming.** This is strong evidence against H. This structure is the primary reason for the current status quo. The continued grants to deworming via this fund show the system is functioning as intended, making a change to the top list less necessary. The likelihood ratio P(E|H)/P(E|~H) is significantly less than 1.
*   **Evidence 2: New positive meta-analysis (June 2024).** This is the strongest evidence for H. New, positive evidence provides a compelling reason for GiveWell to re-evaluate its rankings and potentially justify a change in strategy or list composition. The likelihood ratio P(E|H)/P(E|~H) is greater than 1.
*   **Evidence 3: Shrinking high-value opportunities.** GiveWell's May 2025 notes on phasing out support in some regions suggest that the portfolio of the most cost-effective deworming opportunities may be shrinking. This reduces the "Room for More Funding" argument, a key criterion for top charity status. This is evidence against H, with a likelihood ratio less than 1.
*   **Evidence 4: Proximity to deadline.** The question resolves in about two months. GiveWell's recommendations are typically announced in November. Such a short timeframe means that institutional inertia is a very powerful force favoring the status quo. This is strong evidence against H.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
I begin with a prior of 10% (1:9 odds).

The structural factors (Evidence 1 & 4) are the most powerful pieces of evidence. They represent the established, ongoing strategy and inertia. This evidence is far more likely given ~H than H. I estimate a combined likelihood ratio of approximately 1/5 for these factors, pushing the odds from 1:9 to 1:45 (a probability of ~2%).

The new meta-analysis (Evidence 2) provides a strong counter-argument. This new information could plausibly trigger a re-evaluation and change. I'll estimate this evidence is 3 times more likely given H than ~H (LR = 3). This updates the odds from 1:45 to 3:45, or 1:15 (a probability of ~6%).

The shrinking opportunities (Evidence 3) provide a further small nudge downwards. This might have an LR of around 1/1.5. This updates the odds from 1:15 to 1:22.5, for a final probability of around 4%.

This step-by-step update shows that while the new evidence is important, it struggles to overcome the strong structural and inertial forces that favor the status quo.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My analysis, which results in a low single-digit probability, might be underestimating some key factors.
*   **Alternative Scenario 1: The new evidence is a game-changer.** I might be underestimating the impact of the June 2024 meta-analysis. If GiveWell's internal CEA update shows deworming is now significantly more cost-effective than a current top charity, they might feel compelled to make a change despite the preference for a small list.
*   **Alternative Scenario 2: A slot opens unexpectedly.** If one of the four current top charities were to encounter a major problem (e.g., a scandal, operational failure, or suddenly closing its funding gap), a deworming charity would be a prime candidate to fill the vacancy. The probability of this is low over a two-month period, but it is not zero.
*   **The Metaculus Community:** The community prediction for this question is 10%. This suggests that my forecast of ~4% might be too low and that the arguments for "Yes" are being given more weight by a group of informed forecasters.

Considering these points, especially the small but real chance of a slot opening up or the new evidence being more impactful than I assume, I should adjust my probability upward from the 4% calculated. These tail risks are important. An adjustment to 7% seems more robust, acknowledging the strong arguments against a change while not entirely dismissing the plausible paths to a "Yes" resolution.

### Final Forecast
The final forecast reflects a balance between the strong inertia and strategic rationale for keeping the current list, and the countervailing force of new positive evidence and low-probability "black swan" events. The structural factors are dominant, pushing the probability well below the 10% base rate. However, the possibility of a surprise driven by the new evidence or a change in the status of a current top charity warrants a forecast in the high single digits rather than the very low single digits.

Final: 7%
