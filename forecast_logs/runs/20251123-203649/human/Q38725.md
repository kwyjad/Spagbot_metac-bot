### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Major US Presidential Initiatives:** Programs launched with significant presidential capital (e.g., PEPFAR, Millennium Challenge Corporation, PMI). These initiatives often develop strong bipartisan and institutional support, making them highly resilient to termination. In the last 40 years, it is rare for such a program to be completely eliminated rather than reformed or having its funding altered. **Base rate of termination within the first year of a new, opposing administration: <5%.** This is derived from the persistence of programs like PEPFAR across multiple administrations with differing ideologies.
2.  **Specific US Foreign Aid Programs Targeted for Elimination:** A narrower class includes programs explicitly targeted by an incoming administration's political platform (e.g., certain climate funds, UN population funds). These have a higher probability of being affected, but termination often requires congressional action, which can fail or be delayed. **Base rate of successful termination within one year of targeting: 20-30%.** This rate is higher but reflects that even explicit targeting does not guarantee elimination due to congressional inertia or pushback.
3.  **USAID-Implemented Programs Under Hostile Administrations:** Programs run by agencies, like USAID, that are ideologically disfavored by a new administration. While the agency itself may face restructuring or budget cuts, individual successful programs within it often survive due to specific constituencies. **Base rate of a specific, high-profile program like PMI being eliminated as part of a broader agency takedown: 10-15%.**

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-02-26** USAID OIG report notes PMI failed to prioritize high-burden countries. **↑** — Provides a technocratic justification for "ineffectiveness" that the administration could use to legitimize termination.
*   **2025-05-13** KFF report confirms FY2025 funding was ~$1 billion, but highlights the new 2021-2026 strategy. **↓** — Establishes the program's significant scale and existing multi-year strategy, creating institutional inertia against sudden termination.
*   **2025-10-16** KFF reports the administration's FY 2026 budget request for malaria is $424 million, a ~58% cut. **↑** — A severe budget cut signals intent, but a request for funding (even if reduced) is not the same as a request for elimination. It keeps the program alive, for now.
*   **2025-11-01 (inferred)** Mass layoffs at USAID are well underway, as reported in late February and likely accelerating through the year. **↑** — Severely degrades PMI's operational capacity, potentially leading to a *de facto* termination even if the program legally exists.
*   **2025-11-15 (inferred)** No waiver for PMI has been announced, months after PEPFAR received one. **↑** — This is a powerful signal. The administration is making a distinction, actively choosing not to protect PMI while protecting a similar health initiative.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Executive Unilateralism:** The President can use executive orders, hiring/firing authority, and control over agency leadership to dismantle a program's operational capacity. The ongoing USAID layoffs are a prime example. **Size: Large.**
2.  **Congressional Power of the Purse:** The ultimate mechanism for termination is defunding. Congress must pass appropriations bills. An administration's budget request is a strong signal, but Congress can and often does ignore it. A Continuing Resolution (CR) could maintain funding by default. **Size: Large (but constrained).**
3.  **Ideological Motivation:** The administration's "America First" foreign policy views foreign aid skeptically. This provides a consistent ideological driver for actions against programs like PMI, making a reversal of course less likely. **Size: Moderate.**
4.  **Bipartisan Legacy & Support:** PMI is a signature achievement of President George W. Bush. This creates a powerful legacy constituency within the Republican party, alongside a strong faith-based and public health coalition, that can lobby Congress to resist termination. **Size: Moderate (countervailing).**
5.  **Bureaucratic Inertia/Collapse:** A program can "cease to exist" by becoming non-functional. By removing key personnel and freezing funds, the administration can achieve a *de facto* termination, making a later *de jure* one a formality. **Size: Large.**

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Speed and Aggressiveness:** The actions taken since January 2025—an immediate aid freeze via EO, mass layoffs at the implementing agency—are far more aggressive and rapid than typical administrative transitions.
*   **Targeting of the Implementing Agency:** Past administrations might target specific programs, but the direct, large-scale dismantling of USAID is an unusual and more fundamental threat to all its initiatives, including PMI.
*   **The PEPFAR Contrast:** The explicit granting of a waiver to PEPFAR while withholding one from PMI is a highly unusual and specific signal. It shows this is not an indiscriminate freeze but a targeted prioritization where PMI is losing.
*   **Short Time Horizon:** The question resolves on Jan 1, 2026. This is very soon. The administration's fast actions could outpace the typically slow counter-mobilization from Congress or advocacy groups. Congressional budget battles often result in Continuing Resolutions, which could paradoxically save the program by funding it at previous levels past the deadline, but the administration's executive actions may make that funding unusable.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a prior from the reference classes, perhaps an average around **10%**, reflecting the historical resilience of such programs (equivalent n of ~20-30).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   **↑ (Large):** Aggressive executive actions (aid freeze, USAID layoffs) severely degrade operational capacity, moving towards a *de facto* termination.
    *   **↑ (Large):** The specific denial of a waiver for PMI, in stark contrast to the waiver granted to the similar PEPFAR program, is a powerful signal of specific negative intent.
    *   **↑ (Moderate):** The proposed ~58% budget cut for FY26 shows a clear desire to cripple the program, though it's not a request for full elimination.
    *   **↓ (Small):** The program's strong bipartisan legacy (G.W. Bush) and large scale create political headwinds against outright, formal termination by Congress.
*   **Net effect:** The recent, highly specific, and aggressive negative evidence vastly outweighs the historical base rate and institutional inertia. The posterior probability should move substantially upward, likely into the **40-60% range**.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators (favoring YES):**
    *   A formal White House or State Department announcement of PMI's termination or merger.
    *   Key Republican appropriators (e.g., chairs of the SFOPS subcommittee) publicly supporting the administration's proposed cuts or elimination.
    *   Passage of an FY2026 appropriations bill (or a CR) that explicitly zeroes out funding for PMI.
    *   Further high-profile resignations or firings of PMI leadership.
*   **DOWN indicators (favoring NO):**
    *   A specific waiver is belatedly granted to PMI.
    *   Congress passes a Continuing Resolution that funds PMI at or near FY2025 levels without prohibitive language.
    *   A strong, public pushback from former President George W. Bush or a coalition of influential conservatives and faith leaders.
    *   The administration pivots focus due to a new international crisis, deprioritizing the foreign aid fight.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Definitional Ambiguity:** The program could become a hollowed-out shell, non-functional but technically still "existing" on paper. The resolution criteria ("ceases to exist," "no longer continuing to operate as a distinct organization") seem to cover this, but a borderline case is possible.
*   **Congressional Gridlock:** The most likely short-term outcome for the budget is a series of Continuing Resolutions. This would likely fund PMI by default, pushing a final decision past the Jan 1, 2026 deadline, unless the administration can fully block the funds administratively.
*   **Information Asymmetry:** We are observing external signals (press releases, news reports). The crucial internal debates within the White House and Congress that will determine the outcome are opaque.
*   **Head Fake Risk:** The administration's actions could be a maximalist negotiating position with Congress, with the intent to settle for a smaller but still significant cut to PMI, not full elimination.
*   **Scenario is Fictional:** The provided background is a plausible future scenario. The analysis relies on extrapolating from real-world political dynamics (e.g., Trump's first term, Project 2025 proposals) into this specific, fabricated context.

**Final Research Summary:**
While major bipartisan initiatives like PMI are historically very durable, the current administration's uniquely rapid and aggressive executive actions, particularly the dismantling of USAID and the pointed refusal to grant PMI a waiver, provide strong evidence that this case will deviate sharply from the historical norm, creating a high probability of termination before 2026.

To forecast the probability of the President’s Malaria Initiative (PMI) ceasing to exist before January 1, 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - **Base Rate:** Given the historical resilience of major US presidential initiatives, the base rate for termination within the first year of a new, opposing administration is <5%. However, considering the specific targeting of USAID-implemented programs under hostile administrations, the base rate for a high-profile program like PMI being eliminated is 10-15%. I will use a base rate of 10% as a starting point, reflecting the historical durability of such programs but acknowledging the current administration's aggressive stance.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - **Similarities:** PMI, like other major initiatives, has strong bipartisan support and a legacy of success, which typically protects it from termination.
   - **Differences:** The current administration's aggressive actions, such as the executive order targeting foreign aid, mass layoffs at USAID, and the specific denial of a waiver for PMI, are more severe than typical transitions. These actions suggest a higher risk of termination than the historical norm.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Aggressive Executive Actions:** The likelihood of these actions if PMI is to be terminated (P(E | H)) is high, while the likelihood if PMI is not to be terminated (P(E | ~H)) is low. This evidence increases the probability of termination.
   - **Denial of Waiver:** The specific denial of a waiver for PMI, while PEPFAR received one, is a strong signal of intent to terminate. This evidence also increases the probability.
   - **Budget Cuts:** The proposed 58% budget cut indicates a desire to cripple PMI, further increasing the probability.
   - **Bipartisan Support:** The historical bipartisan support and legacy of PMI slightly decrease the probability of termination.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - **Prior Odds:** 10% probability translates to odds of 1:9.
   - **Likelihood Ratio:** Considering the strong evidence for termination (aggressive actions, waiver denial, budget cuts), the likelihood ratio is significantly greater than 1. For illustration, let's assume a likelihood ratio of 4:1.
   - **Posterior Odds:** 1:9 × 4:1 = 4:9.
   - **Posterior Probability:** 4 / (4 + 9) = 4/13 ≈ 30.8%.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - **Overconfidence Check:** The aggressive actions are strong indicators, but the historical resilience of such programs and potential congressional pushback should not be underestimated.
   - **Alternative Scenarios:** A potential pivot in administration focus or a strong congressional intervention could preserve PMI.
   - **Adjustment:** Given the aggressive actions but also considering potential congressional inertia and historical resilience, a slight upward adjustment is warranted.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Considering all evidence and adjustments, the final probability of PMI ceasing to exist before January 1, 2026, is estimated at 45%.

Final: 45%

# Will the President's Malaria Initiative program cease to exist before January 1, 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to identify an appropriate base rate for a major U.S. foreign aid program being terminated within the first year of a new administration that has expressed skepticism toward it.

Looking at relevant reference classes:
- Major presidential global health initiatives (like PEPFAR, PMI) have historically been resilient across administrations
- Programs explicitly targeted by incoming administrations for cuts or elimination
- USAID-implemented programs under administrations skeptical of foreign aid

The most appropriate base rate appears to be around **15%**. This reflects that while major presidential initiatives like PMI typically persist across administrations due to bipartisan support and institutional momentum, the current situation has several unusual factors that increase termination risk.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- PMI is a major presidential initiative with bipartisan historical support
- It has demonstrated effectiveness (saving ~940,000 lives from 2005-2017)
- It was established by a Republican president (George W. Bush), creating some constituency within the party
- Foreign aid programs typically face scrutiny during transitions but rarely face complete elimination

**Key differences:**
- The Trump administration has taken unusually aggressive and rapid action against foreign aid programs (EO 14169 specifically targeting USAID)
- USAID is undergoing mass layoffs, severely undermining operational capacity
- PEPFAR received a specific waiver on February 1, 2025, while PMI did not, showing a deliberate choice to not protect PMI
- The PMI website is already showing error messages, suggesting operational disruption
- The administration has requested a 58% budget cut for FY2026, signaling intent to dramatically reduce the program
- The resolution date (January 1, 2026) is very soon, giving limited time for congressional or advocacy pushback

These differences significantly increase the likelihood of termination compared to the historical base rate.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Executive Order 14169 targeting USAID**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.9) - If the administration intends to terminate PMI, targeting its implementing agency is a logical first step
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.4) - The administration might target USAID broadly while still preserving specific programs
- Likelihood ratio: ~2.25
- This evidence moderately increases the probability of termination

**Evidence 2: PEPFAR received a waiver while PMI did not**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.95) - If planning to terminate PMI, the administration would deliberately exclude it from waivers
- P(E|~H): Low (~0.2) - If planning to maintain PMI, it would likely receive similar protection to PEPFAR
- Likelihood ratio: ~4.75
- This evidence strongly increases the probability of termination

**Evidence 3: Mass layoffs at USAID**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.9) - Dismantling staff capacity is consistent with program termination
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.5) - Staff reductions could occur while maintaining core programs
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.8
- This evidence moderately increases the probability of termination

**Evidence 4: PMI website showing error message**
- P(E|H): High (~0.8) - Technical infrastructure neglect often precedes formal termination
- P(E|~H): Low-moderate (~0.3) - Could be temporary technical issues
- Likelihood ratio: ~2.67
- This evidence moderately increases the probability of termination

**Evidence 5: Proposed 58% budget cut for FY2026**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.9) - Severe budget cuts often precede complete elimination
- P(E|~H): Low (~0.15) - Such dramatic cuts while intending to maintain the program would be unusual
- Likelihood ratio: ~6.0
- This evidence strongly increases the probability of termination

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior probability of 15% (odds of 0.176):

First update (Executive Order targeting USAID):
- Prior odds: 0.176
- Likelihood ratio: 2.25
- Posterior odds: 0.176 × 2.25 = 0.396
- Posterior probability: 0.396 / (1 + 0.396) ≈ 28.4%

Second update (PEPFAR waiver exclusion):
- Prior odds: 0.396
- Likelihood ratio: 4.75
- Posterior odds: 0.396 × 4.75 = 1.881
- Posterior probability: 1.881 / (1 + 1.881) ≈ 65.3%

Third update (USAID layoffs):
- Prior odds: 1.881
- Likelihood ratio: 1.8
- Posterior odds: 1.881 × 1.8 = 3.386
- Posterior probability: 3.386 / (1 + 3.386) ≈ 77.2%

Fourth update (Website issues):
- Prior odds: 3.386
- Likelihood ratio: 2.67
- Posterior odds: 3.386 × 2.67 = 9.04
- Posterior probability: 9.04 / (1 + 9.04) ≈ 90.0%

Fifth update (58% budget cut):
- Prior odds: 9.04
- Likelihood ratio: 6.0
- Posterior odds: 9.04 × 6.0 = 54.24
- Posterior probability: 54.24 / (1 + 54.24) ≈ 98.2%

This seems too high given remaining uncertainties. Let me reconsider more conservatively.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

My analysis may be overconfident for several reasons:

**Potential overestimation of evidence strength:**
- The likelihood ratios I assigned may be too extreme
- I may be double-counting correlated evidence (e.g., EO and layoffs are related)

**Alternative scenarios:**
- Congress could pass a Continuing Resolution funding PMI at previous levels
- Republican supporters of PMI (especially those connected to Bush) might successfully advocate for its preservation
- The administration might settle for severe cuts rather than elimination
- The program might be restructured/renamed rather than terminated

**Definitional considerations:**
- The question resolves as "Yes" if PMI ceases to exist, merges with another program, or has funding eliminated
- However, a severely cut but still technically existing program would resolve as "No"

**Time constraint:**
- The January 1, 2026 deadline is very soon, giving limited time for formal termination processes
- Administrative processes to fully eliminate programs often take longer than expected

Given these considerations, I should adjust my probability downward from the mechanistic Bayesian calculation.

## 6. Final Forecast

After considering the base rate, the specific evidence, and potential overconfidence in my analysis, I believe the probability that the President's Malaria Initiative will cease to exist before January 1, 2026 is approximately 75%.

This reflects:
- The strong signals from the administration (targeting USAID, excluding PMI from waivers, proposed budget cuts)
- The operational degradation already underway (website issues, staff layoffs)
- The short timeframe until resolution (just over a month)
- Balanced against the historical resilience of such programs and potential congressional intervention

Final: 75%

Here is a probabilistic forecast following the specified methodology.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The event in question is the termination of a major, established, bipartisan US presidential initiative within the first year of a new, ideologically opposed administration. I will use a blended base rate from a few reference classes:
- **Major Presidential Initiatives (e.g., PEPFAR, PMI):** These are historically very resilient due to broad bipartisan and institutional support. The base rate of termination is very low, likely under 5%.
- **Specifically Targeted Foreign Aid Programs:** Programs explicitly targeted by a new administration face a much higher risk. The base rate of successful termination within a year could be estimated at 20-30%, acknowledging that congressional inertia often prevents complete elimination.
- **Programs within a Targeted Agency:** PMI is run by USAID, which the new administration is targeting for mass layoffs. The base rate for a specific high-profile program being eliminated as part of a broader agency takedown is likely in the 10-15% range.

Given that PMI is a resilient program within a targeted agency and is being implicitly targeted itself, a starting prior that averages these considerations is appropriate. I will select a prior probability of **15%**. This acknowledges the program's inherent durability while accounting for the unusually hostile environment. In odds, this is approximately 1-to-5.6 against termination.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation deviates significantly from the historical base case in several ways:
- **Speed and Aggressiveness:** The administration's actions—an immediate executive order freezing aid and initiating mass layoffs at the implementing agency (USAID)—are far more rapid and aggressive than typical administrative transitions.
- **Targeting Specificity (The PEPFAR Contrast):** The administration granted a waiver to PEPFAR, a similar G.W. Bush-era global health program, but has not done so for PMI. This is not an indiscriminate freeze; it is a specific, differential treatment that singles out PMI as a lower priority at best, and a target for elimination at worst.
- **Short Time Horizon:** The question resolves on January 1, 2026, less than a year into the new administration. This short timeframe favors the power of swift executive action over the slower, more deliberative counter-efforts of Congress.

These differences suggest that the historical base rate of resilience is a poor guide and that a significant upward adjustment is necessary.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will evaluate the key pieces of evidence and their impact on the probability of PMI's termination (H).

- **Evidence 1: Mass layoffs at USAID and the aid freeze EO.**
  - This evidence is much more likely if the administration intends to terminate PMI (P(E|H) is high) than if it intends for PMI to continue (P(E|~H) is moderate, as they might just want to "reform" the agency). This evidence provides a clear mechanism for a *de facto* termination by destroying operational capacity. It strongly increases the probability.
  - **Likelihood Ratio (P(E|H)/P(E|~H)):** High (>1).

- **Evidence 2: PEPFAR receives a waiver, but PMI does not.**
  - This is the most powerful piece of evidence. This specific choice is extremely likely if the plan is to terminate PMI while preserving PEPFAR (P(E|H) is very high). It is very unlikely if the plan were to preserve both programs (P(E|~H) is very low). This isolates PMI and removes the political cover of it being part of a respected class of programs.
  - **Likelihood Ratio:** Very High (>>1).

- **Evidence 3: The administration's FY2026 budget requests a ~58% cut to PMI.**
  - This is ambiguous. On one hand, it signals a clear intent to cripple the program. On the other, requesting any funding at all is evidence against a plan for complete elimination. However, the budget for FY2026 is unlikely to be passed by the resolution date. The government will most likely operate under a Continuing Resolution (CR) based on FY2025 funding levels. Therefore, this evidence is more a signal of long-term intent than a direct mechanism for termination before Jan 1, 2026. It moderately increases the probability of a *de facto* termination.
  - **Likelihood Ratio:** Moderately High (>1).

- **Evidence 4: PMI's bipartisan legacy (G.W. Bush creation).**
  - This is the primary evidence against termination. This legacy creates a powerful coalition (Republicans, faith-based groups, public health advocates) to lobby Congress for protection. This evidence is more likely if PMI survives (P(E|~H) is high) than if it is terminated (P(E|H) is moderate).
  - **Likelihood Ratio:** Less than 1.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
- **Start with Prior Odds:** 0.15 / 0.85 ≈ 0.176.
- **Update with Evidence 1 & 2 (Executive Actions & PEPFAR contrast):** These are the strongest signals. The specific targeting of PMI by withholding a waiver, combined with the gutting of its parent agency, is exceptionally strong evidence. A combined likelihood ratio of 5 seems conservative.
  - New Odds = 0.176 × 5 = 0.88
  - New Probability = 0.88 / 1.88 ≈ 47%
- **Update with Evidence 3 & 4 (Budget Request vs. Legacy):** The budget request points toward crippling the program, while the legacy provides a strong force for its survival, likely through congressional action (like a CR). These forces are in opposition. The legacy and likelihood of a CR funding the program are strong arguments for its *de jure* survival. However, the administration's executive actions may still lead to a *de facto* termination where the program is non-operational. The net effect of this conflicting evidence is to increase the probability slightly further, as the executive path to a non-operational state seems more plausible within the short timeframe than the legislative path to saving it.
- **Final Posterior:** The initial update brings the probability to near 50%. The remaining evidence pushes it higher. The administration's demonstrated willingness to act quickly and specifically against PMI outweighs the slower, more uncertain defense from Congress and legacy supporters. The final probability should be above 50%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
The strongest counter-argument is that the administration's actions are a maximalist negotiating position and that congressional gridlock will result in a Continuing Resolution that funds PMI at previous levels, ensuring its legal existence past the deadline. A "zombie" program that is funded but non-operational might not meet the resolution criteria of "ceasing to exist," creating ambiguity. This scenario is plausible and prevents the forecast from being extremely high.

However, this view may underestimate the administration's determination and the effectiveness of its executive actions. The resolution criterion "no longer continuing to operate as a distinct organization" seems broad enough to cover a scenario where the program has been completely hollowed out, even if it technically receives funding. The speed and specificity of the actions described in the prompt suggest this is not just political theater but a concerted effort at dismantling the program. The evidence for termination appears stronger than the evidence for survival.

### 6. Final Forecast
The base rate for such a program's survival is high, but the evidence presented describes a uniquely aggressive and targeted effort to dismantle it. The specific denial of a waiver for PMI while granting one to the similar PEPFAR program is a powerful signal of intent. The mass layoffs at USAID provide a direct, non-legislative mechanism to achieve a *de facto* termination by making the program non-operational. While congressional support and the program's legacy are strong countervailing forces, they are likely too slow to fully counteract the swift executive actions before the January 1, 2026 deadline. The evidence strongly points to a greater than 50% chance that PMI will cease to exist, primarily by becoming non-functional.
