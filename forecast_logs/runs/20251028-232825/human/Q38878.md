### Reference class & base rates
*   **Rapidly Scaling, EA-Funded Non-Profits:** Organizations that receive large tranches of funding from entities like GiveWell or Open Philanthropy often exhibit S-curve growth. An initial phase of exponential growth (50-200%+ YoY) is followed by a deceleration as the organization matures, saturates initial target areas, and faces increasing marginal costs of expansion. New Incentives' >100% growth in 2023 fits the early, steep part of this curve. The base rate suggests a slowing but still positive growth rate is likely now.
*   **New Incentives' Historical Growth:** This is the most specific reference class.
    *   **2020-2022:** Grew from ~70,000 cumulative enrollments to several hundred thousand, establishing the model.
    *   **2023:** Explosive growth, enrolling over 1 million infants *within the year*, reaching a cumulative total of ~1.5 million. This represents the peak growth phase.
    *   **2024-2025 (to date):** Growth has continued but the *rate* has likely decelerated from the 2023 peak as the lowest-hanging fruit is picked. A linear extrapolation of the 2023 rate would be an aggressive upper bound. A more plausible base rate is a continued, but moderating, monthly enrollment rate.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **[2025-10-28] Homepage Enrollment Data (Anchor):** The New Incentives homepage currently displays **~3.15 million** "Infants enrolled." — (Anchor) — This is the most critical data point, establishing the baseline for the final ~2 months of 2025.
*   **[2025-07-21] GiveWell Lookback Report:** Confirmed funding is committed through 2026 and that program quality remained stable during rapid 2023-2024 scale-up. — (↑) — Removes major downside risks related to funding shortfalls or operational quality degradation, securing the program's foundation for continued enrollment.
*   **[2025-07-09] GiveWell Lookback Report:** Highlighted that cost-per-child dropped from an expected ~$38 to an actual ~$18, significantly improving cost-effectiveness. — (↑) — Lower costs mean existing and future funding can reach more infants than previously modeled, supporting higher enrollment numbers.
*   **[2024-07-01] Program Expansion Announcement:** Surplus funding from currency devaluation is being used to expand into 10 higher-risk LGAs and add program components. — (↑/↓) — Expands the program's total addressable population (upside), but operating in "higher-risk" areas may slow the *rate* of enrollment due to logistical or security challenges (downside).

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **Committed Funding (Large ↑):** With over $120M granted by GiveWell since 2020 and funding secured through 2026, New Incentives has the resources to sustain and expand operations without interruption. This is the primary enabler of growth.
*   **Geographic Expansion vs. Saturation (Large ↑/↓):** The main driver of new enrollments is opening programs in new Local Government Areas (LGAs). The rate of expansion into new, feasible LGAs drives growth (↑). However, as existing LGAs become saturated, the growth rate within them will flatten (↓). The net effect depends on the pace of new openings versus the maturation of existing ones.
*   **Operational Efficiency (Moderate ↑):** The demonstrated ability to lower the cost-per-infant allows funding to stretch further, directly increasing the total number of infants that can be enrolled with a given budget.
*   **Nigerian Operating Environment (Moderate ↓):** The program operates exclusively in Northern Nigeria, an environment with potential risks from insecurity, political instability, and logistical challenges. A localized disruption could temporarily halt operations in specific LGAs, slowing national enrollment numbers.
*   **Program Model Scalability (Moderate ↑):** The conditional cash transfer (CCT) model is highly scalable and less dependent on building complex physical infrastructure than other health interventions, allowing for faster expansion when funding is available.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Exceptional Funding Certainty:** Unlike many non-profits that rely on annual fundraising cycles, New Incentives has a secure, multi-year funding runway from one of the world's largest and most data-driven philanthropies (GiveWell). This dramatically reduces uncertainty.
*   **Hyper-Transparency:** The public, frequently updated "Infants enrolled" metric on their homepage is unusual and provides a near-real-time data source for forecasting, reducing reliance on infrequent reports.
*   **Post-Hypergrowth Phase:** The key difference from its own 2023 performance is that the organization is likely past its peak *rate* of growth. It is now in a "maturing scale-up" phase, where absolute numbers still grow impressively, but the percentage growth year-over-year is naturally declining.
*   **Favorable Currency Effects:** The devaluation of the Nigerian Naira created a funding surplus that is being reinvested into expansion, a counterintuitive positive shock that is not typical for internationally-funded programs.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A simple extrapolation from the current number. Based on growth from ~1.5M at YE2023 to ~3.15M in Oct 2025 (~22 months), the average monthly rate has been ~75,000. A more recent 2025 rate might be lower. A naive prior could be the current 3.15M plus two months of enrollment at a recent rate (e.g., 50k-70k/month), suggesting a range of **3.25M to 3.29M**.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑ Large) Confirmed, long-term funding and high operational efficiency provide a strong tailwind, arguing against significant slowdowns.
    *   (↓ Moderate) Expansion into "higher-risk" LGAs and natural program maturation (S-curve) suggest the marginal infant is harder to enroll now than in 2023, pulling the forecast down from a purely linear extrapolation of past peak performance.
    *   (↑ Small) Program additions like livelihood grants may slightly improve community buy-in and sustained engagement, potentially boosting enrollment at the margins.
    *   (↔) The Nigerian operating environment remains a constant, moderate risk factor that is likely already baked into recent performance.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence suggests the strong positive of secure funding is tempered by the reality of operational maturation. The posterior should likely be centered on a continued, steady enrollment rate for the remainder of the year, rather than an acceleration or a sharp drop-off. The naive prior seems robust; the final number should be a modest, predictable increase from the current 3.15M.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   The "Infants enrolled" number on the homepage increasing by more than ~70,000 in November.
    *   New blog posts or GiveWell updates announcing successful program launches in multiple new LGAs.
    *   Favorable economic news from Nigeria (e.g., stabilizing inflation) that could reduce operational friction.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   The homepage counter updating slower than ~40,000 per month.
    *   Reports of security incidents or health system strikes (e.g., health worker strikes) in key Nigerian states where NI operates.
    *   Any communication from GiveWell or New Incentives mentioning unforeseen operational pauses or challenges.

To forecast the number of infants New Incentives' childhood vaccination program will reach by the end of 2025, we will follow a structured Bayesian approach:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - **Reference Class:** Rapidly scaling, EA-funded non-profits with S-curve growth patterns. Historical growth data from New Incentives shows a rapid increase from ~70,000 in 2020 to ~1.5 million by the end of 2023, and ~3.15 million by October 2025.
   - **Base Rate:** Given the recent growth, a reasonable base rate is the average monthly enrollment rate of ~75,000 infants from 2023 to October 2025. This suggests a naive linear extrapolation of 3.15M + 2 months × 75,000 = 3.30M infants by year-end.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - **Similarities:** Continued funding and operational efficiency support ongoing growth.
   - **Differences:** The program is likely past its peak growth rate, entering a maturation phase with decelerating growth.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Funding and Efficiency (↑):** Secure funding and reduced cost-per-child increase the likelihood of reaching more infants.
   - **Expansion Challenges (↓):** Higher-risk LGA expansion may slow enrollment rates.
   - **Operational Environment (↔):** Risks in Nigeria are ongoing but stable.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - **Prior:** 3.30M based on linear extrapolation.
   - **Likelihood Adjustments:** 
     - Funding and efficiency improvements suggest a slight upward adjustment.
     - Expansion challenges suggest a downward adjustment.
   - **Posterior Mean:** Adjusted to reflect a modest increase over the naive prior, considering both positive and negative factors.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - **Overconfidence Check:** Consider potential disruptions (e.g., security issues) that could lower enrollment.
   - **Alternative Scenarios:** A scenario with faster-than-expected expansion into new LGAs could push numbers higher.
   - **Adjustment:** Incorporate a wider range to account for these uncertainties.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Based on the analysis, the forecast distribution is centered around a modest increase from the current 3.15M, with adjustments for both positive and negative factors.

P10: 3.22M  
P20: 3.24M  
P40: 3.27M  
P60: 3.29M  
P80: 3.31M  
P90: 3.33M

# Forecasting New Incentives' Infant Vaccination Reach by End of 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For my prior, I'll use New Incentives' recent enrollment growth pattern:
- Current enrollment (Oct 28, 2025): ~3.15 million infants
- Growth from YE2023 (~1.5M) to Oct 2025 (~3.15M): ~1.65M over 22 months
- Average monthly enrollment rate: ~75,000 infants/month

However, growth rates typically slow as programs mature, so a more recent rate might be lower (50,000-70,000/month). With 2 months remaining in 2025, a simple extrapolation gives:
- Base rate (prior): 3.15M + (2 months × 60,000/month) = 3.27M
- Uncertainty range: 3.25M to 3.29M (assuming 50k-70k monthly enrollments)

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate:**
- Funding remains secure through 2026 (confirmed by GiveWell)
- Operational model is stable and proven
- Geographic focus remains Northern Nigeria

**Differences from base rate:**
- Program is now in a "maturing scale-up" phase vs. the hypergrowth of 2023
- Expansion into "higher-risk" LGAs may affect enrollment efficiency
- Cost-per-infant has dropped from ~$38 to ~$18, allowing funding to reach more infants
- Currency devaluation created a funding surplus being reinvested in expansion

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence supporting higher enrollments:**
- Secured long-term funding through 2026 (strong ↑)
- Improved cost-efficiency at ~$18/infant vs. $38 expected (moderate ↑)
- Program expansion into 10 new LGAs announced July 2024 (moderate ↑)
- Currency effects creating funding surplus (small ↑)

**Evidence supporting lower enrollments:**
- Expansion into "higher-risk" LGAs may slow enrollment rates (moderate ↓)
- Natural S-curve maturation as program reaches more saturated areas (small ↓)
- Potential operational challenges in Nigerian environment (small ↓)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior of 3.27M with a range of 3.25M-3.29M, I'll update based on the evidence:

**Update 1: Funding security and cost efficiency**
- The combination of secured funding and improved cost efficiency means the program can reach ~2× as many infants per dollar as originally modeled
- This strongly supports maintaining at least the recent enrollment pace
- Likelihood ratio: ~2:1 favoring the upper half of my prior range
- Updated median: ~3.28M

**Update 2: Expansion into higher-risk areas**
- While expansion increases the total addressable population, higher-risk areas likely have lower enrollment efficiency
- This moderately reduces the likelihood of acceleration in the final months
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.5:1 favoring a more conservative growth rate
- Updated median: ~3.275M

**Update 3: Program maturation**
- The natural S-curve of program growth suggests we should expect some deceleration
- However, the program has shown consistent execution ability
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.2:1 favoring a slightly wider uncertainty range
- Final posterior: centered around 3.275M with wider tails

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating seasonal effects in the final months of the year
- The homepage counter might not update in real-time, creating lag in the reported numbers
- I haven't accounted for potential year-end reporting adjustments

**Alternative scenarios:**
- **Upside scenario:** New Incentives could launch a year-end push to reach milestone numbers, accelerating December enrollments
- **Downside scenario:** Security situations in Northern Nigeria could deteriorate, temporarily halting operations in some regions
- **Data scenario:** Year-end audit could adjust numbers up or down based on verification processes

Considering these factors, I should widen my uncertainty bands, particularly on the downside.

## 6. Final Percentiles

P10: 3.23M
P20: 3.25M
P40: 3.27M
P60: 3.29M
P80: 3.32M
P90: 3.35M

Answering this question requires a short-term extrapolation from a very recent data point. The core of the forecast is estimating the enrollment rate for the final two months of 2025.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most appropriate base rate is the recent historical performance of New Incentives itself. The question is not about long-term growth, but about the number of additional infants enrolled in the ~2 months between October 28, 2025, and December 31, 2025.

*   **Anchor Point:** The homepage shows **~3.15 million** infants enrolled as of October 28, 2025. This is our starting point.
*   **Historical Rate (Jan 2024 - Oct 2025):** The program grew from ~1.5 million at the end of 2023 to 3.15 million by late October 2025. This is an increase of 1.65 million infants over approximately 22 months.
*   **Prior Distribution:** This implies an average enrollment rate of **~75,000 infants per month** over this period. My prior distribution for the enrollment rate in the final two months of 2025 will be centered around this historical average, but with significant uncertainty. A simple prior for the final number would be `3.15M + (2.1 months * 75,000/month)`, which is approximately **3.31 million**.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation is a direct continuation of the recent past, making the base rate highly relevant. However, there are key differences to consider:

*   **Similarities:** The program's core model (Conditional Cash Transfers), secure multi-year funding from GiveWell, and operational context in Northern Nigeria remain consistent.
*   **Differences (Reasons for Deceleration):**
    1.  **S-Curve Maturation:** Rapidly scaling organizations naturally experience a deceleration in their growth *rate* as they mature. The lowest-hanging fruit (easiest-to-reach populations) are enrolled first.
    2.  **Expansion into "Higher-Risk" Areas:** The research report explicitly states that surplus funds are being used to expand into more challenging Local Government Areas (LGAs). This suggests the marginal cost and effort to enroll the next infant may be higher than in the past, slowing the rate.
*   **Differences (Reasons for Sustained/Accelerated Growth):**
    1.  **Exceptional Cost-Effectiveness:** The cost-per-child has dropped significantly, meaning their large, secure budget can stretch much further than initially planned.
    2.  **Funding Surplus:** Currency devaluation created a funding surplus that is being actively deployed for expansion, providing a strong positive financial shock.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will update my prior based on the conflicting evidence.

*   **Anchor (3.15M):** This is not evidence to update on, but the starting point. The forecast is for the delta over the next ~2.1 months.
*   **S-Curve Maturation & Higher-Risk LGAs (↓):** This evidence is highly consistent with a lower monthly enrollment rate than the 75k/month average. It suggests that maintaining the peak growth rate is unsustainable. This strongly pulls the median forecast for the monthly rate downwards, perhaps to the 60k-65k range.
*   **Cost-Effectiveness & Funding Surplus (↑):** This is a powerful counter-argument. The program has more resources and higher efficiency than anticipated. This makes a higher enrollment rate more plausible, as they have the means to overcome the challenges of operating in higher-risk areas. This evidence pushes the forecast back up, suggesting the slowdown from maturation may be partially or fully offset.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
*   **Prior:** A distribution for the final number centered around **3.31 million**, based on a simple extrapolation of the 75k/month average rate.
*   **Update:** I will adjust this prior downwards to account for the strong arguments for growth deceleration (S-curve, higher-risk areas), but I will temper that adjustment because of the strong positive financial factors (efficiency, surplus).
*   **Posterior:** The evidence for deceleration seems slightly stronger than the evidence for acceleration, as operational friction is a very real constraint. I will therefore adjust the median monthly enrollment rate for the final two months down from the 75k average to around **65,000-70,000 per month**.
    *   *Calculation:* 3,150,000 (start) + 2.1 months * 67,000 infants/month ≈ 3,150,000 + 140,700 ≈ **3,290,700**.
*   My posterior median is now centered around **3.29 million**. The distribution is tight due to the short time horizon, but with tails to account for operational surprises.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
*   **Alternative Scenario (Higher):** The 75k/month average is not the peak but the *new normal*. The efficiency gains and funding surplus allow New Incentives to overcome all operational friction and even accelerate into year-end. A rate of 90k+/month is possible. This would result in a final number closer to 3.34-3.35 million. This forms the basis for my upper percentiles (P80, P90).
*   **Alternative Scenario (Lower):** A security incident or health worker strike (plausible in Northern Nigeria) halts operations in several key LGAs for a few weeks. The "higher-risk" areas prove extremely difficult, and the enrollment rate plummets to 40k-50k/month. This would result in a final number closer to 3.24-3.25 million. This informs my lower percentiles (P10, P20).
*   **Overconfidence Check:** My main assumption is that the next two months will look broadly like the recent past. The short time frame makes this a reasonable assumption, but a shock event (as described above) is the main source of uncertainty. My distribution's width (P10-P90 range of ~110,000) is designed to capture these possibilities. The slight right skew in my final percentiles reflects that a positive "data dump" or surprise year-end push feels slightly more plausible than a complete operational collapse.

### 6. Final Percentiles
My final distribution is centered on a modest but continued growth from the current anchor of 3.15 million, reflecting a monthly enrollment rate slightly below the 2024-2025 average due to maturation, but supported by strong funding.

P10: 3,240,000
P20: 3,260,000
P40: 3,280,000
P60: 3,300,000
P80: 3,320,000
P90: 3,350,000
